    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese leader Xi Jinping arrives for the fourth plenary session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2018. (Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images) The news of China abolishing term limits for the state chairman position has led many to speculate that current chairman Xi Jinping may rule for life. Many media surmised that China would soon return to a Mao Zedong-like dictatorship. Others, including The Epoch Times, analyzed Xi’s move as indicative of his need to further consolidate his power within a party still fractious and embroiled in factional battles. Officials loyal to former Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin make up a major oppositional force to the Xi leadership—though at last October’s important political conclave, the 19th National Congress, the Jiang faction saw its power weakened after Xi was able to appoint many of his allies to top positions. In recent days, analysts and media around the world have offered alternative readings of why Xi set off this precedent-breaking maneuver. If he did not cement his power at all levels, it could also hit him after his second term in office: downfall, jail, and prison sentence. — From an analysis by Austrian newspaper Die Presse Xi had made too many enemies with his anti-corruption campaign that felled thousands of Party bigwigs, so “if he did not cement his power at all levels, it could also hit him after his second term in office: downfall, jail, and prison sentence,” according to Austrian newspaper Die Presse, in an analysis published on March 12.

(Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images) Some of those top officials include Zhou Yongkang, the former security czar and right-hand man to Jiang; Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, two powerful military generals; and Ling Jihua, chief political adviser to Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao. Meanwhile, Chenshen Yen, researcher at National Chengchi University’s Institute of International Relations in Taiwan, told Radio Free Asia that he believes Xi abolished term limits not necessarily to serve another term himself but to prevent oppositional forces from gathering power to name their own successor, “for example, if Hu Jintao made his choice for Xi’s successor.” “In the past, the Party leader skips a generation to appoint the following leader,” Yen said, referring to the practice since Deng of the incumbent being able to appoint the leader who follows his immediate successor. Last year, Xi purged Sun Zhengcai, who was widely believed to be Xi’s successor. Sun was closely aligned with the Jiang faction. Deng Yuwen, a researcher at the China-based think tank Charhar Institute, penned an editorial in the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post explaining why he thinks it’s unlikely Xi will serve for life. “To repeal the term limits, Xi would have needed the consent of senior party members. If he is forcing the rule change without such a consensus, he may worsen divisions in the leadership, which would impede the working of his own government. Thus, Xi is likely to have promised the party elite that he would not wreck the institution of political succession by staying in power for life,” Deng wrote in an article published on March 14. Deng also pointed out that the regime is keen to maintain its image and would not want to risk the public’s negative reaction to a leader-for-life—especially given the fervent voices of opposition on Chinese social media (which were quickly censored) upon announcement of the Party’s plan to abolish term limits.

    <title><![CDATA[Security Spending Soars in China’s Troubled Xinjiang Region]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F19%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese soldiers participate in an anti-terror drill in Hami, Xinjiang region, China on July 8, 2017. (Reuters) BEIJING—Spending on security-related construction tripled in 2017 in China’s far western region of Xinjiang, where Beijing is accused of detaining as many as one million ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims, an academic analysis of government expenditure found. Beijing says its “vocational training centers” in Xinjiang camps teach employment skills and legal knowledge aimed at curbing religious extremism. The report published on Nov. 5 by U.S. think-tank the Jamestown Foundation examined government budget data and found spending on security-related construction in Xinjiang rose last year by nearly 20 billion yuan ($2.90 billion), or 213 percent. “Xinjiang’s budget figures do not reflect increased spending on vocational education…as the region ramped up camp construction; nor do they reflect an increase in criminal cases handled by courts and prosecutors,” said the report’s author, Adrian Zenz, an anthropologist at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany. “Rather, they reflect patterns of spending consistent with the construction and operation of highly secure political re-education camps designed to imprison hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs with minimal due process.” It also found that despite the purported large “vocational training” campaign, employment outcomes had not markedly improved, according to Xinjiang’s own official employment figures. Whatever training the facilities do provide, Zenz said, it appeared it was not administered or paid for by the vocational education system. The Xinjiang government and the State Council Information Office, which doubles as the Communist Party’s spokesman’s office, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Tuesday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she did not personally know how much Xinjiang’s security expenditure was. Reports of mass detentions and strict surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims have prompted the United States to consider sanctions against officials, such as Xinjiang Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo, and companies linked to accusations of human rights abuses. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers proposed legislation on Oct. 10 that would urge U.S. President Donald Trump to condemn “gross violations” of human rights in Xinjiang and to press his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to close the “political re-education camps” immediately. Other sanctions raised for consideration by the proposed act include a ban on sales or provision of U.S.-made goods or services to Xinjiang state agents and the barring of certain Chinese entities—including the Xinjiang police bureau—from purchasing U.S.-made equipment that could be used for surveillance. Over the years, Xinjiang has been transformed into a vast security state, packed with police stations, street cameras, and security checkpoints at which electronic identity cards are scanned. After initial blanket denials, Chinese officials said in recent weeks they were not enforcing arbitrary detention and political re-education across a network of secret camps, but rather that some citizens guilty of “minor offenses” were sent to vocational centers to provide employment opportunities. While prison expenditure doubled between 2016 and 2017, spending on prosecution on criminal suspects was largely flat, Zenz said, indicating it was likely that few of the so-called criminals involved only in minor offenses were put on formal trial. China’s record will be examined by the U.N. Human Rights Council on Tuesday, the first time since 2013, in a regular review expected to focus on its treatment of ethnic minorities, especially Uyghurs and Tibetans. By Philip Wen.

    <title><![CDATA[In Communist China, Reform Is a Dead End]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F18%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[A Chinese paramilitary policeman reacts outside the opening session of the Chinese Communist Party's five-yearly Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Nov. 8, 2012. (MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images) Xiang Songzuo, deputy director and senior fellow at the Center for International Monetary Research at China’s Renmin University, delivered a speech on Dec. 16 that detailed a series of problems afflicting the Chinese economy. His prognosis is much more gloomy than what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is willing to admit. At the end of his speech, Xiang proposed three reforms: tax reform, political reform, and national reform. These were clearly meant as suggestions to authorities on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of China’s “reform and opening up.” But those who harbor hope that the Party will restart reforms 40 years after the first round are likely to be disappointed. Regardless of who heads the Party today, it’s impossible to return to the era of Deng Xiaoping, the CCP leader who initiated economic reforms in 1978. In fact, the seeds of the failure we see now were planted at the onset of Deng’s reforms. Those reforms began right after the end of the Cultural Revolution. Almost every aspect of economic development had to be started from scratch, and there was no clear policy on anything. The two most important and well-known policies were simply “easing restrictions” and “crossing the river by feeling the stones.” It’s now widely agreed that the reform movement is dead, with the only debate being as to when it died. Some say it was over in 1989, after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Another explanation puts it 20 years later, in 2008 or 2009. There are those who say that reform was “alive” until after 1989, when it was shifted to serve the power of the Party elite. However, the students gunned down at Tiananmen were already protesting against the forces of corruption and privilege in the reforms. Even in the earliest developments of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when one may have genuinely spoken of reform, we must still consider what it was that was being changed. The reform began in the countryside, in the small village of Xiaogang in Anhui Province. Eighteen villagers signed a life-or-death contract to split up their collective farm. The document guaranteed that if the village cadre was arrested, the entire village would help raise his children to adulthood. How courageous of them to stand up to the political pressure facing them! But who was pressuring them? It was the Communist Party. The rural reform was none other than to break the Party’s yoke. How is it that the Party took credit for this achievement? In the cities, reform followed the model of allowing some people to get rich first; that is, to allow the existence and development of the private economy and its development. In both the urban and rural experiences, the early reforms were nothing more than denying the “three major transformations” of the pre-reform period of communist rule, including the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. These “achievements” were the elimination of private ownership, while the reform and opening up was the partial recovery of private ownership. Why should both be considered the CCP’s achievements, when it would have simply been better to not undertake the socialist transformations in the first place? Later reforms included reform of state-owned enterprises as part of China’s entry to the WTO, which had the side effect of causing a large number of workers to lose their jobs, while shifting ownership of state assets to the elites for criminally low prices. Other “reforms” include those in education, health care, and housing. In communist propaganda, the term “three great mountains” refers to the oppressive imperialism, feudalism, and capitalist bureaucracy from which the CCP claimed to have liberated the Chinese people. Today, education, health care, and housing are widely mocked as the “new three great mountains.” Party officials from the central to local levels seem to have a special preference for “reform,” since it benefits the CCP elite. In this sense, all officials are “reformists” and there are no “conservatives.” The positive aspects of China’s economic reform are that it partially restored the “old society” that existed prior to the establishment of the communist regime, and that it brought in foreign technology and managerial methods. But there was never any political reform in the meaningful sense of the word, and, thus, never any reformists. Some people think that the abolition of lifelong leadership and the establishment of “collective leadership” constituted political reform, yet the Tiananmen Square Massacre happened anyway. And the brutal persecution of Falun Gong that has lasted 19 years was begun under the “collective leadership” of Jiang Zemin and his factional allies. Whatever the circumstance, the CCP has never corrected its cyclical pattern of periodic human-rights abuses. The history of the Communist Party’s rule is filled with such tragedies. The Lushan Conference of 1959 failed to correct the “leftist inclination” of the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign, and instead, a further 20 million people starved to death after Mao Zedong’s ideological assault on the “rightists.” Under Deng’s Four Cardinal Principles that re-established the political supremacy of the CCP and Marxism, the liberalizing tendencies were doomed, and reformist leaders such as Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang were purged. The historical pattern shows that there’s something in the nature of the CCP that makes true reform impossible. Today, the CCP faces an ideological and theoretical dilemma in every aspect of its existence, from political economy to diplomacy. This is an inevitable result of the four decades of partial reform, which occurred only with great internal contradictions. No reform can be successfully implemented if its goal is to save the Party’s rule.

    <title><![CDATA[Woman Dies 3 Months After Prison Release: Years of Torture Damaged Her Body]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F17%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[A reenactment of a Falun Gong practitioner being tortured by police in a detention center. (Minghui.tv) Before she succumbed to her injuries, Liu Zhenfang filed a criminal complaint recounting her ordeal—a harrowing description of how the Chinese communist regime destroyed her body, but could not break her faith—over twenty long years. Liu, a 60-year-old resident of Huangchuan County, Henan Province passed away on Dec. 7, 2018, three months after her release from Henan Women’s Prison, according to Minghui.org, a U.S.-based website that serves as a clearinghouse on the persecution of Falun Gong in China. Her body was emaciated, and most of her internal organs had festered. In 2017 Liu had been sentenced to a 1.5-year prison term for practicing Falun Gong, a spiritual discipline which upholds the tenets of truth, compassion, and forbearance. Those who subscribe to this belief have been persecuted by the Chinese communist regime from 1999 to the present day. The Persecution Liu, a hairdresser, began practicing Falun Gong in 1998 after hearing about its health benefits at a time where China’s health reforms were outdated. Falun Gong, which translates to “law wheel practice,” is a spiritual discipline with a set of meditation exercises and texts that preach virtues, containing moral philosophies with Buddhist and Taoist elements, and draws on China’s long tradition of qigong, a regimen of controlled breathing and gentle physical movements. When then Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Jiang Zemin launched a systematic campaign to vilify and destroy Falun Gong in 1999, Liu refused to renounce her faith, and became a police target. Her house was ransacked three times between 1999 and 2003. In early 2000, Liu was detained in the Hedian Detention Center, where police extorted 2,000 yuan from her before she was released. Her second arrest in 2001 saw police bring her to a secret detention facility after finding Falun Gong materials in her home. Liu was forced to stand overnight without sleep, and the police took all the money she brought with her. Police interrogated Liu for the source of the materials, and she was beaten for more than 20 hours for her silence. Her head was slammed against a wall, and clumps of hair were pulled out, resulting in scalp injuries. She was hung from the window frame with handcuffs and beaten until she vomited blood. She was sent to the Hedian Detention Center again and held for three months, until her family paid the deputy director at the Domestic Security Division to secure her release. In 2004, Liu was arrested for distributing Falun Gong materials. Following her incarceration, she was beaten for 16 hours by police at the Guangshan Police Department. They pulled her hair and ripped her clothes. When the officers became tired of beating her barehanded, they used a metal rod and took turns hitting her until the rod was broken. They used the broken metal rod to beat her fingers. Then she was taken to the Guangshan Detention Center, where she was beaten for 33 hours. Her internal organs were damaged, and following these attacks, she often vomited blood. Liu survived the torture. The police also detained Liu’s husband in 2004 for five months, despite him not being a Falun Gong practitioner. He was forced to do slave labor and was given one meal per day. Guards tied his testis with a thin thread and burned it with a lighter. Liu was arrested again in 2012. She was sentenced to a five-year prison term, where her ordeal continued. Despite her injuries, she was forced to work for 14 hours every day. In 2017, Liu was handed another prison term for 1.5 years, and it would end up killing her. During Liu’s total time in incarceration, she was also verbally abused, fed nerve-damaging drugs, forced to do slave labor, stand for days without sleep, and squat for hours with her hands on her head. Before the persecution, Falun Gong had an estimated 70 million to 100 million adherents in China across every social class, including members of the communist party. Meditating practitioners were a common sight in parks and public squares in every city.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Whose Hearts, Livers and Lungs Are Transplanted in China?]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F11%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[It’s not always clear where human organs come from in research papers. (Piron Guillaume/unsplash) Scientist He Jiankui’s claimed use of the genetic tool CRISPR to edit the genomes of twin girls led to international condemnation. His actions have focused a spotlight on research ethics—and what the consequences should be when scientists “go rogue.” The Chinese Academy of Science initially looked into He’s conduct, and a subsequent internal government investigation has allegedly identified multiple violations of state laws. He has now been fired by his university. But beyond just this example, what does happen when scientists fail to comply with globally-accepted guidelines for ethical medical research? We examined this issue focusing on published research involving recipients of organ transplants performed in the People’s Republic of China. International professional standards ban publication of research that: involves any biological material from executed prisoners lacks human research ethics committee approval lacks consent of donors. But as described in our new paper, we found that research which does not comply with these standards is regularly accepted for publication in international peer-reviewed journals. Human organ transplants in China Using a scoping review methodology, we examined 445 studies published in peer-reviewed English language journals between January 2000 and April 2017. The papers reported research involving recipients of human organ transplants (limited to hearts, livers or lungs) taking place in China. The data included 85,477 transplants. We found that 92.5 percent of the publications failed to state whether or not the transplanted organs were obtained from executed prisoners. Nearly all of them (99 percent) failed to report whether organ donors gave consent. In contrast, 73 percent of papers reported approval from an institutional ethics committee for the research reported in the paper. Widespread ethical concerns over the inability of condemned prisoners to give informed consent for organ donation are exacerbated in the People’s Republic of China. Here, the judicial and police system lacks safeguards against procedural abuses. Faulty convictions are extensively documented and extremely difficult to redress. In addition, a growing body of credible evidence suggests that organ harvesting is not limited to condemned prisoners, but also includes prisoners of conscience. It is possible therefore—though not verifiable in any particular case—that peer reviewed publications may contain data obtained from prisoners of conscience killed for the purpose of organ acquisition. Who is responsible for ensuring that data based on research involving organs harvested from non-consenting prisoners is banned from publication? We argue in our paper that reviewers and journal editors have a role to play. Where do the organs come from? In 19 papers involving 2,688 organs transplanted prior to 2010, the source of organs was reported as voluntary donors. But as widely known in the transplantation community, there was no volunteer deceased organ donor program in China before a pilot started in 2010. It therefore seems reasonable to assume that organs may have been sourced from prisoners, making claims about volunteer donation unreliable. The two journals that published the greatest number of Chinese transplant papers identified in our study are Transplantation Proceedings, with 65 of the total 445 papers, and PLOS ONE, with 20. Other journals with papers identified by this study include the American Journal of Transplantation, and Transplantation (the official journal of the peak international body, The Transplantation Society). These journals both have policies that explicitly prohibit the publication of research based on organ transplants from non-consenting and/or prisoner donors. We argue that, if they are not already doing so, reviewers and medical journals should demand information about the source of organs in Chinese transplant research before these are published for the broader public and scientific communities. If they are demanding such information, the responses to those demands should be published. And if they are not satisfied with the responses, they should refuse to publish the research. When a paper is published without identifying the source of the transplanted organs, it risks sending the message that ethical standards may be ignored or breached. This undermines the incentive to comply with these standards in the future. We’re all responsible Our findings raise important and disturbing questions about ethical oversight on the part of all of those involved in the process of reviewing and publishing transplantation research. In response, we propose large-scale retractions of the papers identified by our research that are not consistent with international standards regarding organ donation. We also propose a moratorium on all clinical transplant publications from China pending an international summit. The summit of transplantation community members and other stakeholders could develop appropriate policies and processes for handling future research. Our hopes for these retractions are, however, not high. As one of us (Rogers) found, securing a retraction can be a prolonged process even where there is evidence of overt falsehood in the paper. An article retracted due to concerns about the source of organs used for donation. (Screen shot/John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd/The conversation) Journals are reluctant to retract articles, and even retracted articles continue to be widely cited. Nevertheless, there is growing interest in trying to uphold the integrity of published research, as well as initiatives to demand the publication of all clinical trial data. These initiatives offer some hope that breaches such as the ones we discovered will become less common. As for the authors involved in retracted or ethically non-compliant research, there is little information about the impact on their careers. Being the author on a paper that is retracted may lead to a ban by the journal, trigger an institutional investigation, or have no effect. Academic misconduct investigations by universities are rarely reported in the public domain. Apart from high profile cases like that of He, the nature and extent of the consequences for researchers who breach ethical standards is largely unknown.

    <title><![CDATA[Australian State Senator Condemns Forced Organ Harvesting in China]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F10%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[During a rally joined by thousands of Falun Gong practitioners at Taipei 23 April 2006, four demonstrators play in an action drama against what they said was the Chinese communists’ killing of Falun Gong followers and harvesting of their organs in concentration camps. (Patrick Lin/AFP/Getty Images) On June 17, 2019, an independent people’s tribunal&nbsp;found that it was “beyond doubt” that state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting for profit has been taking place in China for years and “on a significant scale.” The Independent Tribunal Into Forced Organ Harvesting of Prisoners of Conscience in China, known as the China Tribunal, found that these organs are principally sourced from imprisoned prisoners of conscience—the majority of whom are Falun Dafa practitioners. The panel of international experts concluded in their final report that this practice is still taking place. Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, chair of the China Tribunal into forced organ harvesting on the first day of public hearings in London on Dec. 8, 2018. (Justin Palmer) Tribunal chairman, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, stated that “very many people have died indescribably hideous deaths for no reason.”&nbsp;Nice previously led the prosecution of former Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal. The panel described its findings as “indicative” of genocide, and called for international intervention. But Nice said the Tribunal noted with disappointment that “both the UK and Australian governments have expressed no desire properly to test the allegations by themselves or through the United Nations.” Australian Government Yet to Make a Stand Over the years, Victorian Greens Senator Janet Rice has lent her voice in strong condemnation of forced organ harvesting, yet few of her fellows have joined her in speaking out against this practice. “It is horrific and it just underlines what has been previously documented,” Senator Rice told The Epoch Times. Janet Rice, the newly elected Senator for Victoria, spoke at a rally against China’s organ harvesting crimes in downtown Melbourne, Australia, on Sept. 22, 2013. (The Epoch Times) “Countries including Australia need to let China know that this is unacceptable and to hold them to account. “At the very least, we have got to restart our annual Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, which we have not had since 2014. We have to continue to push for China to allow international human rights observers into China so that there can be some further investigation of the extremely concerning evidence that has been revealed through this inquiry process.” However, according to Senator Rice, the Australian government has not yet shown interest in the China Tribunal’s findings. “I think the last thing that happened in our Parliament with relation to organ harvesting in China was a motion that went through the Senate, co-motioned by myself and Senator Eric Abetz (a Tasmanian Liberal Senator), who I don’t agree with much,” she laughed. “But on this issue, we agree. Senator Eric Abetz in discussion with Janet Rice in the Senate at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, on Nov. 29, 2017. (Michael Masters/Getty Images) “We called on the government to consider making it an offense to travel overseas to receive an organ acquired from a non-consensual donor. And that we should also establish a register of people who travel overseas to receive transplants including details on the country they received them in.” The Australian Senate passed motion 121 on Nov. 24, 2016, that acknowledged the problem of unethical organ harvesting in foreign countries including forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience. It recommended the Australian government legislate against its citizens traveling overseas to procure organs from non-consenting donors. “But nothing happened,” said Senator Rice. “I think it’s basically we’ve got both the Labor and Liberal parties who are too scared to upset China,” she said. “They are more concerned about our economic relationship with China and they are willing to overlook these absolutely egregious human rights abuses that are going on.” Senator Rice pointed out that whether it’s the Chinese regime’s harvesting of organs from live Falun Dafa practitioners, the imprisonment of millions of millions of Uyghur people, the persecution of Tibetans, or the kidnapping of Chinese democracy activists in China, it is apparent that the Chinese Communist Party is guilty of appalling human rights abuses. During a rally joined by thousands of Falun Gong practitioners at Taipei 23 April 2006, four demonstrators play in an action drama against what they said was the Chinese communists’ killing of Falun Gong followers and harvesting of their organs in concentration camps. (Patrick Lin/AFP/Getty Images) Dr. Enver Tohti, 57, a former Chinese surgeon who gave evidence before the China Tribunal, described his work at an execution site in Urumqi in northwest China. He was ordered to operate on a man whom Tohti claimed had not been anaesthetised, and who had a gunshot wound on his chest. “I started cutting down the middle and then he started struggling and I knew then that he was still alive,” Tohti told The Telegraph, “but he was too weak to resist me.” “I saw there was blood coming out of the cut which means the heart is still pumping,” said Tohti. He was ordered to remove the victim’s liver and both kidneys. Tohti said he was told by his bosses to “remember that today, nothing happened.” When asked about what steps members of the public can take to bring this issue to the attention of the government, Senator Rice said: “Well I certainly think reading the report of the Tribunal … and the power of actually going and visiting your elected representative is something very powerful that people can do. “In fact, I just reflect upon how it was Falun Gong practitioners right back in 2006 who did that very thing for me when I was Mayor of the City of Maribyrnong. That was 13 years ago, and it was that evidence that was put in front of me that really began my passion for taking action about the appalling situation of human rights in China.” Senator Rice also emphasized the importance of raising awareness in the community “because the vast majority of Australians don’t know what’s going on. “And they should, because China is our biggest trading partner, and by being silent, we are basically being complicit in the human rights abuses going on in China. “So every Australian who benefits from that trading relationship with China has a responsibility to actually inform themselves about what is going on.” Considerations for the Australian Government Michael Danby MP, introduces the Magnitsky Bill (The International Human Rights and Corruption Bill 2018) in the Lower House of the Australian Parliament on Dec. 3, 2018. (Parliament of Australia) According to Senator Rice, Australia has several actions and sanctions which it could consider. For example, by increasing the enforcement of immigration controls against human rights violators through an Australian version of laws known globally as Magnitsky Acts. These laws allow governments to sanction murderers and torturers&nbsp;acting on behalf of states. A future Australian Magnitsky-style law could see Chinese officials involved with the mass incarceration of Uyghurs blocked from entering the country, with their visas rejected and assets frozen. “There are a range of people, including the Greens party room, who are looking at the potential of that … the sorts of sanctions that would be in a Magnitsky Act—I think absolutely should be on the table for discussion.” Senator Rice also noted that there needs to be more action bilaterally, with individual nations working together and having a dialogue with China about what is going on. “China, up until now, has avoided having any powerful sanctions brought into play against them because essentially they have seen to be too big to be putting offside,” she said. “But this just cannot continue. It is part of the flight into abuse of human rights, and so downgrading of the importance of democracy and individual human rights, that it is untenable. “I think we cannot have a global world order with China having increasing power, whilst this attack on people and crimes against human rights continues. “I want us to have a peaceful, productive relationship with the people of China, and for those relations to be strong. These relations are threatened whilst China’s actions are having such an impact on the rights of their own citizens.”]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[In Xinjiang, Even Buying Sugar Can Send You to an Internment Camp]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F9%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Police patrolling as Muslims leave the Id Kah Mosque after the morning prayer on Eid al-Fitr in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China, on June 26, 2017. (Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images) Reproduced from Bitter Winter:&nbsp;A magazine on religious liberty and human rights in china Armed police patrols, public security checkpoints, facial recognition—the ubiquitous surveillance is an inevitable and intrusive part of daily life for residents of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The expansive surveillance, introduced under the pretext of stability maintenance, have brought fear and anxiety, instead of the promised peace and tranquility. The authorities continuously adopt more, often absurd, control measures. White Sugar Controlled as a Material for Explosives Considered as a top priority policy, stability maintenance for the Xinjiang authorities means total control of the population. The previously adopted measures included the requirement to engrave ID numbers on cutting tools and attached them to an iron chain before use; an order for businesses to purchase riot control gear to participate in compulsory drills; every day items are included into lists of strictly controlled articles, and many more. The stability maintenance policy has brought great inconvenience to people’s lives. A prohibitionist measure introduced by the authorities in Xinjiang last year, however, is hard to comprehend: White granulated sugar has been listed as a controlled item as well, restricting and rationing its purchase. The measure has been adopted supposedly to regulate the sale of materials used for making explosives. A resident from Shihezi City revealed that as early as last November, he was required to present his ID card when buying white granulated sugar. The salesperson told him that if he didn’t register his ID number, and the Public Security Bureau finds this out, he will be arrested and put in a “study class,” referring to compulsory indoctrination of people. The salesperson also revealed that once, a clerk sold white granulated sugar to a customer who didn’t bring his ID card, and was fined 4,000 yuan (over $ 510) and sent to “study.” Only a kilogram of white sugar can be purchased with one ID card, according to the new regulations.

(Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images) Face Scans to Enter Home Surveillance and control measures invade deep into people’s lives, restricting them in every respect. At the entrances to some residential complexes in Urumqi City, the capital of Xinjiang, one can frequently see people lining up outside the rotating gate, waiting to scan their ID card or face, to enter their home. The machine not only verifies the identity of residents; more importantly, it records the movements of people for further investigation. If someone doesn’t want to scan their ID card and tries to squeeze through the gate behind someone else, the revolving gate will stop moving, and both people will be trapped inside the gate. According to locals, since last September, these identity-detecting revolving gates have been installed in many residential complexes in Urumqi. All the personal information of residents has already been entered into the system. An elderly person said frankly that such complex entry procedures had caused a great deal of inconvenience. “In the evening, I want to go for a walk, but as soon as I think about how much trouble it is to scan my ID card when leaving and returning to the complex, I don’t want to go out anymore.” When the revolving gate was first put into use, residents would often forget to bring their ID card and would need to contact a security guard to open the gate. “We even have to scan our face or scan our ID card when coming home. How is this ‘home’? It’s like being in prison!” a resident said with a sense of helplessness. IDs Checked Constantly in Public Places This situation isn’t limited to residential complexes. The identity-detecting gates have also been installed at produce markets and wholesale markets in Urumqi. People need to swipe their ID card to enter or leave the markets. These measures are very unpopular with residents. A woman in her forties said bluntly that since this kind of gate was installed, she isn’t even willing to go to the market anymore. “This has caused much trouble for people,” she said. “Despite carrying so many things in your hands, you have to scan your ID card when exiting the market. There are so many people going through the gate, and you have to wait in line. It is very tiring. The main thing is that it’s a complete waste of time.” Merchants are also upset about this. However, fearing retaliation from authorities, they suppress their anger and don’t dare to speak out. A shop proprietress complained that the measures are bad for business because people don’t want to come in. “Business at our market isn’t as good as it was before. But no one dares to say anything about it now,” the woman said with fear. “Anyone who speaks out will be arrested. The government guards against the common people even more strictly than it guards against thieves.” People are Fleeing Xinjiang People walking on the streets of Urumqi may also be required to hand over their cellphone on the grounds of testing it for explosives at any time. If the police have any suspicions, they can even arbitrarily look through the content of one’s cellphone. As a result of such high-pressure control, people feel insecure; many are unwilling to live in Xinjiang anymore. An elderly person who moved to Xinjiang told Bitter Winter that if such measures continue, people will move out, and no one will be willing to come to the Uyghur region. “We’re inspected when walking on the streets. We have to swipe our ID card when entering our residential area or when going to a market,” said the man angrily. “It has been five years since I came to Xinjiang, and we’re still being inspected like this. Are we criminals? Are we terrorists?” A man from inner China who came to visit relatives in Xinjiang thinks that the government-imposed control measures are too strict. “I don’t want to stay here,” he added. A merchant at a shopping mall revealed that three people jointly owned it. By July 2018, two of the owners had withdrawn their capital and left Xinjiang. Out of the 46 shops, initially set up at the mall, only 11 remain. By Li Zaili]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Former Chinese Poverty Assistance Director Charged for Taking 10 Million-plus Yuan in Bribes and Misusing Poverty Assistance Funds]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F8%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese migrant workers wait in a bus as they leave after their shift at a construction site on Dec. 9, 2014 in Beijing, China. It is estimated that there are more than 40 million construction laborers in China, many of whom come from smaller centers to the country's larger cities to find work. (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images) Liu Kunming, former poverty assistance director of Shanxi Province, was recently charged with bribery and abuse of power. He accepted bribes from 216 people that total 10.4 million yuan ($1.5 million). According to a July 6 report from Beijing News, among the 216 people, 93 were poverty assistance directors from different counties and cities. These directors tried to get more funds from the provincial level poverty assistance program by reporting inflated numbers of migrants and residents below the poverty line, and falsely claiming some local development projects were qualified to get government funding. Liu accepted a combined 4.2 million yuan ($611,340) from these county or municipal-level poverty assistance directors. Another group of people who bribed Liu were company executives. Liu accepted 5.64 million yuan ($820,940) from 114 company owners and top executives who tried to obtain national or provincial-level Poverty Alleviation and Development qualification or apply for funding or low-interest loans for certain company projects. Other unidentified individuals bribed Liu to get promotions; and a number of veterans bribed him just to secure a job. The prosecutor claimed that Liu’s abuse of power directly caused a loss of over 3.53 million yuan ($513,810) in poverty-assistance funds, according to Beijing News. Liu, 65, took office as the Poverty Assistance director in Shanxi Province in April 2003, and retired in July 2013. Chinese authorities started investigating him in February 2018, almost five years after he retired. He was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and stripped off from retirement benefits for Party officials when his crimes were corroborated. Linfen Municipal Intermediate Court sentenced Liu to 10.5 years in prison and fined him 600,000 yuan ($87,333) on April 23 this year. Misuse of Poverty Assistance Funds Throughout the Country Several other provincial-level poverty assistance directors have been taken down in recent years. For example, in July 2017, Zhang Xiliang, director of Poverty Assistance in Heilongjiang Province, was investigated; in December 2018, Chen Xiaoping, deputy director of Poverty Assistance in Shaaxi Province, was sacked from his position. An official from the Discipline Inspection Committee of Heilongjiang Province, the Chinese Communist Party’s anti-corruption watchdog, revealed at a press conference in August 2017 that Zhang Xiliang and three other poverty assistance officials misused a total of 10 million yuan in funds for non-qualifying regions and projects. In March 2018 during China’s two sessions (National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference) in Beijing, Hu Jinglin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance, disclosed that poverty alleviation funds being misappropriated and falsely claimed is a nationwide problem, and has so far been found to involve 874 counties in 28 provinces. “Some (funds) went into the pockets of corrupted officials, some were squandered, some were used to benefit officials’ relatives or friends, some were misappropriated,” Hu said. Prior to that, Hu Zejun, Auditor General of the National Audit Office revealed in December of 2017 that 970 officials were found guilty of misusing poverty assistance funds. Data released by the National Audit Office in June last year indicated that in 145 poverty-stricken counties, about 4 billion yuan ($582 million) was pocketed by local corrupted officials. Corruption combined with dereliction of duty have caused huge financial losses. Families in Poverty Denied Poverty Alleviation Funds At the same time, it is not uncommon for families living below the poverty line to be denied poverty alleviation funds. In Kangle County, one of the poverty-stricken counties in northwest China’s Gansu Province, a young woman named Yang Gailan applied for a subsistence allowance in 2013. Village officials rejected her request because her family owned three cows, disregarding the fact that the three cows were the family’s only assets. Instead, the village’s subsistence allowances were granted to other families who were much better off financially than the Yang family. In August 2016, Yang committed suicide by taking poison after killing her four children in desperation. Yang’s husband, working as a migrant worker in another city, also committed suicide after he buried his wife and children. &nbsp;]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Behind Xi Jinping Is A Divided Communist Party and Unengaged Officials]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F7%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese leader Xi Jinping delivers a speech at The Great Hall of The People in Beijing on April 30, 2019. (Andrea Verdelli/Getty Images) News Analysis It’s hard to tell what worries Chinese Communist regime leader Xi Jinping the most—the U.S. trade war in front of him, a divided cabinet, or a whole country of corrupt, self-serving and unfaithful communist officials. Divided at the Top While the trade war has exposed China’s many vulnerabilities and scandals to the entire world, behind closed curtains Xi is struggling with what may end up being more devastating than any external challenge: his immediate inner circle is turning against him. China observers have noticed a major shift in Xi’s strategy and personnel choices. After seven years of successful partnership with Vice President Wang Qishan who led anti-corruption campaigns that won Xi a lot of respect, and Premier Li Keqiang who focused on fixing the economy, Xi turned his favor upon strategist Wang Huning and Vice Premier Han Zheng. Both of his new confidantes served, and are likely still serving, Xi’s arch enemy—former regime leader Jiang Zemin. Wang Huning is known for devising radical communist ideological campaigns, theories, and slogans for Xi and his predecessors. Han Zheng leads the now notorious One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative, and is a hardliner behind the recent Hong Kong and Macau unrest. Both were promoted by Jiang, and are said to be key members of Jiang’s “Shanghai Clique,” a group of national political leaders thought to hold allegiance towards Jiang, a political enemy of Xi. While the two have Xi’s trust, their behaviors have called their loyalty into question. Han, for example, criticized the proposed trade accord with the United States during a meeting with two dozen Chinese top leaders on May 13, according to Wall Street Journal. Wang Huning on the other hand, is allowing, if not ordering party media within his control to speak against Xi. In June, Xinhua.net published two articles that bashed those who choose to “surrender” to the United States in the trade war. The articles took an aggressive and menacing tone and were filled with radical and hateful vernacular commonly used during the 1970s Cultural Revolution. “Stop now,” one of the articles warned those who advocate for collaboration or hold a more moderate stance, “before you do anything that harms your family and pleases your enemies.” People familiar with the matter believe the articles targeted Xi, Wang Qishan, and Li Keqiang—all of whom hope to work towards a resolution ending the trade war with the United States. Inaction in the Middle China has the world’s biggest body of government officials. Most of them are in the middle-tier who interpret, execute, and pass on top leadership’s policies. This middle-tier has been a key obstacle against reform and problem-solving, said Xu Zhong, chief of the Chinese Central Bank Research Bureau, in February during a top economic forum. Most of the policy documents are drafted by the middle-tier officials from various functions, he said. These officials hardly ever reached agreement due to understanding gaps and conflicting interests. This results in removal of controversial policies. “These controversial contents are the reforms that we truly need to solve important and challenging issues,” said Xu. Thus, Beijing’s policy changes are often stuck at the middle level due to the officials’ protection of their own interests, but done in the name of seeking cross-functional consensus. And problems, of course, remain unsolved. Corruption at the Bottom Corruption is a stubborn disease in any communist system. In China where the system has been running for almost 70 years, the extent and severity of corruption are jaw-dropping. In the most recent anti-gang campaign, many local officials were found guilty of collaborating with gangs. Their titles ranged from head of local communist party branch, head of the Political and Legal Affairs Commission, and the chief of the Public Security Bureau. Bribery in local elections is also a common practice, which means a large number of local officials acquired their positions illegally. Worse still, a recent survey by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences showed over 45 percent of village committee members were former gang leaders. It’s no wonder that these local officials focus strongly on getting their investment back with their administrative powers. They may be too busy to take seriously the excessive inspection and evaluation teams sent by the central government. As soon as the teams land in a province or township, the inspection turns into a game of bureaucracy and formality. Even for the inspection teams who do take their jobs seriously, the processes are more hinderance than help for the local officials. Between preparing for the inspection team’s arrival and welcome, to making sure they bring back a positive picture, the local officials have little energy to actually get things done. What’s behind all the troubles is the fact that the communist party itself is what truly hinders development and improvement, and what demotivates officials to do their duty. With more direct interaction with the people, the local officials know better than the top leaders how fragile the party is. Today’s officials are unwilling to work hard for the party, and they are planning out their retreat once the party is in crisis. Xi may be aware of the situation. In a February meeting, Xi warned the party is facing dangers from many directions, and that the country needs to be prepared for major hardships ahead. But the junior officials looked on indifferently, as if they are not part of the system. Economist Cheng Xiaonong believes such behaviors of the local officials pose a major political threat for Beijing, because the measures to save the economy will not get implemented. “More importantly,” Cheng said, “such bureaucratic behaviors marks the loss of loyalty on the officials’ part.”]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Police officers stand guard outside the Canadian embassy in Beijing on Jan. 27, 2019. (Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images) TORONTO—A Canadian citizen has been detained in the Chinese city of Yantai, a Canadian government spokesman said on July 13, an incident that comes amid chilly diplomatic relations between the two countries. Global Affairs, as Canada’s foreign ministry is known, did not provide further details or say whether the case was related to the detention of 19 people earlier in the week. Relations between China and Canada nosedived last December after Vancouver police detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co, on a U.S. arrest warrant. Beijing is demanding her return. After Meng’s arrest, China detained two Canadians, accusing them of involvement in stealing state secrets. On July 9, police in Xuzhou, a city in Jiangsu Province, said it had detained 19 people on drug-related charges and that 16 of them were foreigners. Yantai is about 385 miles (620 km) away from Xuzhou. The British Embassy in Beijing said on July 12 that four British nationals have been arrested in eastern China. China’s state radio said some of the detained individuals were teachers at an English education center operated by EF Education First, a privately held Swiss firm that operates in 114 countries.

    <title><![CDATA[Chinese Police Step Up Phone Checks, Using Surveillance Apps]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F06%2F29%2Findex005%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese police question a man (C) in Tiananmen Square, next to the Great Hall of the People, the venue for upcoming meetings of China's legislature in Beijing on March 2, 2015. (GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images) Chinese netizens recently reported that police have begun checking people’s smartphones with a special mobile device at subway stations and on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai. Beijing police said that the tool is only for scanning people’s IDs, but netizens and experts who dug deeper have discovered that the product can extract personal data from smartphones without authorization from the smartphone owner. Checkpoints A Beijing netizen sent a video to the Chinese-language Epoch Times on June 17, which showed that Beijing police have set up a temporary checkpoint at the Dongzhimen Subway Station to check travelers’ smartphones. “The police is checking everything on the phone,” the person shooting the video can be heard saying. Ms. Cheng, a Shanghai dissident, also told U.S.-based broadcaster and sister media NTD that local police on the streets have also begun checking people’s phones. Several netizens from Shanghai and Beijing told NTD that the police mainly check whether there are photos or videos about recent Hong Kong protests against a controversial extradition bill, a topic banned in mainland China. The police also look for whether people have installed virtual private network (VPN) and other apps that can allow users to bypass the Chinese firewall and access foreign websites that are banned inside China. On June 21, the Beijing police department published a statement on its official Weibo account, denying netizens’ complaints that officers were accessing people’s smartphones. In the statement, it said that the police did not take away people’s smartphones, but were using their “mobile police terminals” to check IDs. Surveillance Tool The statement also explained what the device does: “Police can use this ‘smartphone’ [mobile police terminal] to accomplish all types of police work. This device is the perfect embodiment of advanced police technology as well as applying big data.” “Mobile police terminal” devices have proliferated in certain years. Many software developers tout their success at scoring government clients. Xinda Jie’an, for example, said on its website that its devices for police in Henan Province can identify people’s faces after taking their photo. All their background information will then become available to police, including contact information, any prior criminal record, cars and other vehicles that are registered under the person, and so on. For foreigners, their profiles and passport numbers can be accessed after police can take a photo or a finger scan with the device. The police can also input more information about the foreigner’s behavior into the database. In the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where the resident Uyghur population is closely monitored by authorities, Hikvision-developed devices can connect the police network via any mobile carrier, allowing police to upload and download data from people’s phones and into the police database. Meanwhile, Vickn, a developer of mobile communication-based security software, uses hardware manufactured by Chinese tech giant Huawei to operate its police devices. According to its website, Vickn supplies to police in Jiangsu, Ningxia, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces. According to Vickn’s product page, its mobile police terminal can identify people by scanning their fingerprints. Police can then access the person’s file on its database, which includes information on their homes. Surveillance App Since 2016, netizens have complained that after police checked their phones, a MFsocket app mysteriously appears on their phones. They are unable to uninstall it. Recently, netizens again reported this phenomenon. On June 25, a French cybersecurity engineer and vigilante hacker who uses the pseudonym Elliot Alderson, published his research findings on the MFsocket app on Medium.com. Alderson found out: “[MFsocket] is asking a lot of dangerous permissions: – Read your call log, your contacts, your SMS, your calendar, your SD card – Disable the lock screen – Access your location – install a new app without your consent.” “Moreover, we can see that the activity doesn’t have the category launcher which means that this app doesn’t have an icon,” Alderson wrote. He concluded that the app was a surveillance tool. This article previously misreported where the hacker self-identified as&nbsp;Elliot Alderson was based. The Epoch Times regrets the error.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F06%2F29%2Findex004%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Wang Quanzhang with his wife, Li Wenzu, and their son. Wang Quanzhang, a human rights lawyer, has been detained in China without trial since August 2015. (Courtesy of Li Wenzu) It was a long-awaited meeting for both. Li Wenzu had not seen her husband, Wang Quanzhang, since the Chinese lawyer was jailed for his human rights advocacy four years ago. Chinese authorities have continuously denied her visitation rights. She would often travel to the prison he was detained at, and call his name from outside the prison wall, in the hopes that he could hear. Since five years ago, when Wang was arrested and detained by Chinese authorities amid a nationwide crackdown of human rights lawyers and activists in July 2015, Li had been waiting to see her husband’s face. The day before Li’s first-ever scheduled prison visit on June 28, she wrote on Twitter that “the waiting time was so dragged-out.” After traveling nearly 420 miles from Beijing to the Linyi Prison in Shandong Province, Li found the half-hour meeting nothing like what she expected. The prison deployed hundreds of police outside. As Li walked into the reception room with her 6-year-old son, Quanquan, she had to pause for a moment before she could recognize the man. Sitting across the glass window was a thinner, older, and wearier-looking version of her husband. Wang Quanzhang was detained in 2015 and sentenced on Jan. 28, 2019. (Photo from Wang’s family) Changed Person Li said that both Wang’s personality and appearance had changed so much that she would not have recognized him had they met on the street. “I smiled and waved to him in excitement, but he glanced at me without any expression, and tilted his head to the side without looking at me,” Li wrote in a tweet after their meeting. In an interview on June 28, Li recounted to The Epoch Times how their meeting went. She said he appeared happy upon seeing their son, but a sense of worry soon clouded his face. “He wasn’t in a good state, I could tell that he was under extreme stress and fear. We couldn’t even have a conversation,” Li said. Li said that Wang was anxious about her safety. “He expressed concerns that I would be arrested, that our child would be forced out of school.” “He asked me not to visit him in the next few months,” Li said. Li noted that he appeared easily agitated and had difficulty remembering recent events. When Quanquan asked his father whether he had been eating well, Wang said slowly in a robotic voice that he had everything he needed, including extra food. When Li asked what the “extras” were, he began to scratch his head with a troubled look and repeated the question to himself. “I’m fine, the prison has been treating me very well, it’s not like what you guys think,” Wang said in a high tone, claiming that he had put on weight while in prison, Li recalled in her tweet. “Tears streamed down as I looked at the thinned face of Quanzhang … His two front teeth that used to be neatly aligned now shows a huge space in between,” she wrote, adding that Wang seemed like a totally different person. “He looked at me … as if looking at a stranger and not the wife he hasn’t seen for four years.” Li also said she had never heard him speak in that aggressive tone. “He wasn’t like that before, Quanzhang was a mild person,” Li said. “He never lost his temper in front of me.” When the guards ended the meeting, Wang walked away without looking back at them. She observed that five or six guards were monitoring them as they spoke, with another taking notes beside Wang throughout the visit. Another guard was also filming them on a camcorder, according to Li. Li Wenzu (L), the wife of detained human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang, walks on the outskirts of Beijing to Tianjin, where she believes her husband is being held, on April 5, 2018.&nbsp;(Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images) Controlling One’s Mind After he was taken away by police amid the nationwide crackdown, known as the 709 Incident, he was detained for roughly three years. On Jan. 28 this year, in a closed-door trial, Wang was sentenced to four and a half years in prison on charges of subversion—a euphemism for activism that draws the Chinese regime’s ire. In seeking Wang’s release and her visitation rights, Li has met with government officials from different countries, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.K. Ambassador to China Barbara Woodward. Chen Guangcheng, a Chinese human rights lawyer and civil rights activist, told The Epoch Times that the goal of the Chinese Communist Party was to control their thoughts. He suggested that Chinese authorities likely arranged the meeting between Wang and Li so that the sense of desperation and fear would spread from Wang to his family—and stop them from being vocal about his case.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images) Chen fled China to the United States in 2012 with the help of U.S. officials. He had been under house arrest before he planned a daring escape to the U.S. embassy in Beijing. Speaking from his personal experience, Chen said when suppressing dissidents, the Chinese regime often plays with their fears while they are detained in a secluded environment, seeking to inflict mental pressure. “If you don’t cave in, they would use all kinds of ways to ‘educate’ you with fear and threats,” Chen said. “They instill this kind of fear in you, and you don’t know any other information nor the true situation. This will prey on your mind.” Chen said that their ultimate goal was to wear them out until “you no longer care about the injustices in society and just live your life,” Chen said. “They want the shackles to be secured in Li Wenzu and Wang Quanzhang’s minds for the rest of their lives.” Follow Eva on Twitter: @EvaSailEast]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F06%2F29%2Findex003%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[A 21-year-old student has died after falling from a building in Hong Kong on June 29, after leaving an apparent message on the staircase protesting the city’s recent controversial extradition bill, local media reported. Lo Hiu-yan, a first-year female student studying arts at Education University, left a 91-word message at an upper-floor staircase of Fuk Tai building in Fanling, Hong Kong, calling for the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, along with other demands urged by millions of Hongkongers. Over the past few weeks millions of people have taken to the city’s streets to protest a proposed extradition law that would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for trial. Opponents say that given the Chinese regime doesn’t operate under the rule of law, the bill would enable it to seek the extradition of its critics in Hong Kong with impunity. The student fell from the building around 4 p.m. local time on June 29 and was confirmed dead at the scene by ambulance crew, according to Hong Kong media Apple Daily. Unnamed sources told the outlet she had previously participated in anti-extradition-bill protests. According to Apple Daily, her message on the wall, written in red and addressed to Hongkongers, read: “Although we have been fighting for a long time, we must not forget our beliefs from the very beginning and must keep persisting. “[We] strongly demand the complete withdrawal of the [extradition] bill, the retraction of the labeling [of a June 12 demonstration] as a ‘riot,’ the release of [arrested] student demonstrators, the resignation of [Hong Kong leader] Carrie Lam, and the punishment of the police.” The message ended with the line: “I hope to exchange my life for the fulfillment of two million people’s wishes. Please continue to persevere, you all.” Lo also posted a picture of her message on the wall to her Instagram page, Apple Daily reported. Police have since covered her written message with a black sheet, the outlet added. Lo was not a resident of the building. Over a hundred mourners laid flowers and notes at the scene in remembrance of Lo as of the evening of June 29.

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha This is not the first death associated with the protests. On June 15, a 35-year-old man in a yellow raincoat died after unfurling a banner protesting the proposed extradition laws from the side of a shopping mall in Admiralty. The man, wearing a yellow raincoat, called for the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill and for Hong Kong Leader Carrie Lam to step down. Written on the back of his raincoat was “Carrie Lam Kills Hong Kong.” Hongkongers mourned the man in the following weeks. Many left tributes to him with flowers and notes at the scene, and some showed up in yellow raincoats in later protests.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Rights lawyer and university lecturer Liu Shuqing is shown in an undated photo. A university in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong has fired a lecturer and human rights lawyer after he "repeatedly published inappropriate comments" in the media, RFA has learned.Rights lawyer Liu Shuqing, who also works at a public interest law firm, was told to stop teaching classes at the Shandong Qilu University of Technology last year.The university issued a statement accusing Liu of "violating teaching standards of practice" and being a "bad influence."Liu, who was hired to teach by the college's school of chemical engineering, said he had also been rated "unqualified" in a recent staff assessment, although he was the only one in his faculty to fail his assessment.The school will now go through a disciplinary process based on two posts he made on the internet, about a government grading system for lawyers and the abuse of official power.But he said he had never discussed his opinions while teaching, and that there was nothing illegal in either post."I told them that teaching is only one of my professions, but that my identity is as a citizen, and that citizens have the right to freedom of speech," Liu told RFA."Both of these posts are still on WeChat, and haven't been blocked or deleted," he said. "I am very disappointed that the school has punished me anyway."Not yet firedLiu has already been ordered to stop teaching, but hasn't been formally fired. Instead, he has been demoted to the status of teaching assistant.His contract states that the university can fire him if he fails two consecutive annual assessments, however."I have been teaching for more than 10 years," Liu told RFA. "I think I am a very competent teacher. I am qualified ... It is very unfair."He said he would see whether or not the school would accept an offer of arbitration, as hinted at in their letter informing him of the decision.An employee who answered the phone at the university's personnel department declined to comment."I don't know this teacher, and I'm not familiar with the case," the employee said. "You should call the propaganda department."Growing censorshipAcademics say the ruling Chinese Communist Party is stepping up its censorship of academics in an unconstitutional bid to silence even the mildest criticism.Former Guizhou University professor Yang Shaozheng, who was fired outright after he made comments critical of the Communist Party in an online article, said self-censorship in colleges and universities is a growing problem on Chinese campuses."What it means is that no one in this society is willing to insist on justice and the rule of law," Yang said. "They are forcing teachers and other members of society to stay silent about whatever they think is problematic.""If you go on like this for a long time, this country will lose its sense of right and wrong."Liu has previously represented Beijing rights lawyer Wang Yu, who was the first of hundreds to be detained and sanctioned in a nationwide crackdown launched in July 2015.He has also counted New Citizens' Movement found Xu Zhiyong, Harbin petitioner Xu Chunhe, and many other rights activists among his clients.'Political training'Earlier this week, China's education ministry launched a new wave of political training for colleges and universities that aims to instill the ideology of President Xi Jinping and late supreme leader Mao Zedong in staff and students alike.The Ministry of Education released on Monday a five-year training plan for teachers via a series of "political theory" courses in colleges and universities.According to the ministry, "it is necessary to train dozens of ideological and political scholars with extensive influence ... as well as hundreds of leaders in ideological and political education."Under the plan, thousands of teachers and professors will study the classics of Marxism alongside the Thought of Xi Jinping, Mao Zedong, and late supreme leader Deng Xiaoping.The results of their theoretical research should then be integrated into their teaching materials, the ministry said.All colleges and universities will be required to send at least two qualified teachers to participate in the program, achieving full coverage of all Chinese tertiary institutions within five years, it said.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wen Yuqing for the Cantonese Service.

    <title><![CDATA[Former Interpol Chief Stands Trial For Bribery in China's Tianjin]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F06%2F29%2Findex001%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Former Interpol president Meng Hongwei stood trial in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin on Thursday, as his wife said she wasn't sure the man presented on state media footage was her husband.Meng "confessed" to accepting more than U.S. $2 million in bribes and expressed regret for his crime, the Tianjin No. 1 Intermediate People's Court said in a statement.Official footage of the trial aired by state broadcaster CCTV showed Meng in a beige jacket standing between two police officers in a court, with a small group of people sitting behind him.According to the indictment, the charges relate to Meng's tenure as minister, vice-minister and ruling Chinese Communist Party secretary for public security, and as head of the Chinese marine police, between 2005 and 2017.Chengdu-based rights activist Chen Yunfei said the amount Meng was accused of receiving seemed low, compared with bribes of hundreds of millions of yuan (1 million yuan = U.S. $146,000) ascribed to much lower-ranking officials in China."If he really did accept bribes, then this probably wasn't the actual amount," Chen said. "County-level and district-level party secretaries get far larger sums than this.""It's likely that something else is going on here."Last month, France granted political asylum to Meng's wife Grace and the couple's two children, after she told police she was the target of an unsuccessful abduction attempt at the beginning of the year.Meng went missing last year during a trip back to China.He was placed under investigation for corruption at a secret location "on the outskirts of Beijing" after Interpol accepted his resignation with no questions asked on Oct. 7, 2018.Interpol gave no reason for the resignation, nor did it make any public comment on the detention of its president. Meng had been elected to lead the international police agency until 2020.Grace Meng, whose Chinese name is Gao Ge, was left behind in France with scant information, other than a social media message from her husband telling her to "wait for my call," and then a knife emoji signifying danger.Grace Meng said recently that Chinese officials had presented "no proof whatsoever to back up their charges," and has said that she still fears kidnap attempts.Overseas-based Chinese activists say China has a long track record in cross-border abductions.Anti-corruption campaignAn independent Beijing-based scholar surnamed Song said Meng's prosecution, which will almost certainly result in a jail term, is another example of political prosecutions under the aegis of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign."If Meng Hongwei only took bribes of [U.S. $2 million], then he's probably the cleanest official [in China]," Song said."All this proves is that there is factional strife at the highest levels of Communist Party leadership, and that the anti-corruption campaign is selective, and depends on factional struggles," he said.Reports suggest that Meng was appointed vice-minister for public security by disgraced former public security minister Zhou Yongkang, who rose to power at the head of China feared "stability maintenance" system,Zhou was jailed for life by the Tianjin No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in June 2015, after being found guilty of bribe-taking, abuse of power, and disclosure of state secrets in a secret trial.Zhou's sentence came rumors of a political coup attempt to topple Xi by him and jailed former Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai. China's securities regulator Liu Shiyu later told top finance officials during the 19th Party Congress in 2017 that senior figures had "conspired openly to usurp party leadership."Earlier that year, Xi had accused five disgraced party officials, including Zhou and Bo, of involvement in "political conspiracies."Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by the Cantonese Service.

    <title><![CDATA[Calls Grow For an Independent Probe Into Police Violence During Hong Kong Protests]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F06%2F29%2Findex%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Authorities in Hong Kong on Tuesday faced a growing number of calls for a public inquiry into their handling of recent mass protests against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China, as chief executive Carrie Lam canceled a scheduled meeting of her cabinet.Professional and religious organizations called on the government to set up an independent investigation committee to probe the events of June 12 and examine police actions, after Amnesty International said the city's police acted with unlawful force when using tear gas, rubber and textile bullets, and batons to disperse crowds of unarmed civilians on June 12.They said the government's insistence that the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) could handle any complaints was fundamentally flawed, as any complaints end up being investigated by the police themselves."The IPCC is itself part of the police force, and it's very easy to sympathize and see things from one's colleagues' point of view," Sing Ming, associate social sciences professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said.Meanwhile, former colonial-era second-in-command Anson Chan hit out at Lam, saying she bears the greatest responsibility for the government's handling of the political crisis around planned amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which would allow alleged criminal suspects to be sent to face trial in mainland China.Britain also urged Hong Kong to conduct an independent investigation into police actions on June 12."I today urge the Hong Kong SAR government to establish a robust, independent investigation into the violent scenes that we saw," foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told members of parliament. "The outcome of that investigation will inform our assessment of future export license applications to the Hong Kong police."Hunt said no new licenses for "crowd control equipment" would be issued to Hong Kong importers unless human rights concerns were addressed.Clear hostilityBack in Hong Kong, barrister Geoffrey Yeung of the Progressive Lawyers Group, said police tactics in the face of mass protest need to be looked at across the board."We could see for example that there's clear hostility towards journalists or the protesters at the scene, whether there was something that went wrong," Yeung told government broadcaster RTHK. "Was it because the police officers went off the guidelines or was it because the guidelines themselves were problematic?"Hundreds of protesters once more converged on government buildings on Monday, following much larger civil disobedience action by thousands of people on Friday.The government said it wouldn't be holding a scheduled Executive Council (ExCo) meeting, although protesters only targeted immigration and tax headquarters and the Legislative Council (LegCo), before dispersing peacefully."The chief executive was elected by just 1,200 people," a protester surnamed Chan told RFA on Monday, in reference to the Election Committee that is itself hand-picked by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. "That's why she needs to be held to account by the public.""The trouble is that even if one or two million people take to the streets, the government doesn't have to answer to them, so I think that this movement ... is useful, but that it's not going to be enough," he said.'We've already had this'An employee surnamed Cheung who works at Revenue Tower said she is broadly supportive of the protest movement."I do basically support them, but I think we've already had this on Friday, and now they're doing it again, which I think is going to alienate a lot of people," Cheung said."So even though I support them, I don't now, because I think they should have left us some way to go out and buy food and come back in again."Pro-democracy lawmakers accused Lam's administration of hiding from the public by canceling the ExCo meeting."When the government claims they want to connect with Hong Kong people, this is blatantly a disconnection with Hong Kong people," Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung told lawmakers in comments reported by RTHK."The conflict is still in the society about the extradition bill," he said. The government should face up to the conflict ... and not be hiding from the scene."Pro-democracy camp convenor Claudia Mo said officials are very nervous following the mass civil disobedience actions of recent weeks."This government has become a joke for the Hong Kong community and the international community," Mo told reporters.Business as usualDevelopment secretary Michael Wong said much official business is proceeding as normal, however."It's true that the social atmosphere right now is quite tense, and we think that if there is a chance for the society to relax a bit, for everyone to calm down, then we can be pragmatic and do our job," he said.Meanwhile, the government is facing a legal challenge over the failure of special tactical unit police officers to display their identification numbers during clashes on June 12.A local resident has applied for a judicial review after he was told to stop taking pictures of the protests by police, and is calling on the court to ban police officers from carrying out their duties without displaying a valid ID.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Tseng Lap-yin for the Cantonese Service.
