NEW YORK—Around a hundred people dressed in yellow T-shirts and holding colorful banners gathered near the United Nations headquarters on Sept. 24 to send world leaders a message: please help end a brutal persecution in China. For the past 20 years, the Chinese regime has persecuted adherents of the spiritual practice Falun Gong, in an unrelenting campaign involving arbitrary arrests, detentions, brainwashing, torture, and death. Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a meditation practice that includes a set of moral teachings based on truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance. Its immense popularity, drawing an estimated 100 million adherents by the end of the 1990s, was perceived by the communist regime as a threat to its authority. In July 1999, it launched a sweeping campaign to eradicate the practice.Practitioners of the faith group, young and old, told their stories at the U.N. Plaza of how the persecution forever changed their lives.A Trip Back to China Falun Gong practitioner Dou Jinmei at United Nations Plaza in New York, N.Y., on Sept. 24, 2019. (Eva Fu/The Epoch Times)Dou Jinmei, 57, was living in New Zealand when news of the persecution reached her in 1999. For two days, she listened to how China’s state media broadcast hate propaganda vilifying the practice. She felt something was wrong, as she has personally experienced the positive health benefits of practicing Falun Gong exercises. “They are smearing the practice,” she said.Hoping to tell the Chinese government the truth about the practice, Dou and around 20 other New Zealand practitioners flew to Beijing in December 1999, and headed straight to Beijing’s petition office the night they arrived.As soon as the front desk receptionist learned that they were Falun Gong practitioners, he directed them to the backyard of the building, and ushered them onto a bus.“We looked around and realized that a lot of practitioners were already there, perhaps dozens of them,” Dou said. The bus brought them to the Qianmen Detention Center in Beijing, where they were told to take off all their clothes in front of male prisoners to check for “offensive weapons.”Dou remembered a group of guards surrounded a female practitioner from the region of Xinjiang and hit her hard when she questioned why they had to do so.Some were then confined at the Qianmen facility, while others were brought to other detention centers. Detainees were only allowed two restroom breaks per day. “If you urinated or defecated in your pants and they caught it, they will definitely beat you up,” she said.Dou said that during the first night, she lay on a brick bed with all other cellmates right next to each other, “stacked on top of each other,” she said. Her mind was restless.“We are just regular citizens … what, if anything, could be wrong with practicing Falun Gong? Why would [authorities] lock us up here and treat us like this?”Dou went on a hunger strike, along with several other practitioners, to protest the inhuman treatment. As punishment, the guards tortured her by force-feeding liquid through a tube that was inserted into her nose and reached into her stomach. “They said it was milk … when it was poured into the stomach you knew—it was salty water.”“It burns your stomach, and it felt like my lungs were about to explode,” she said. “When your lips dried, there’s a layer of salt.”Dou was detained for a month, during which guards persisted in trying to get her to renounce her faith.“If you want to die, I will let you die this moment,” Dou recalled a guard saying. “If we beat you to death, it will be as good as you committing suicide,” the guard said.After another grueling term at another detention center in her hometown, Dou eventually escaped back to New Zealand in May of 2000, with the help of a Chinese official who took pity on her.“The [Chinese regime] has been persecuting us for 20 years, the world leaders should be clear by now and stand up to stop it,” Dou said.Childhood ShatteredJiang Yinghuan was roughly three years old when her mother left the house in 2000 in order to escape the police who were looking for her.Jiang recalled police officers asking her father where her mother had gone, and after getting a vague answer, turned to her. “The police had a fierce look on his face, and it terrified me,” she said.“My mom had told me that she went out to buy candies, so I told the police that she went to get candies. Then, I started to cry.”But her mother could not bear being separated from her. In 2001, her mother eventually returned to see the family. She was immediately arrested by police who were waiting at the door.Jiang said that her mother spent roughly half a year at a detention center in their hometown of Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang.Because of her mother’s situation, kids bullied Jiang at kindergarten and made nursery rhymes to taunt her. Her school teachers treated her coldly.“It cast a shadow on my mind, and I dared not tell anyone that my mom is a [Falun Gong] practitioner, because she could go to jail again for it. And I got traumatized by my playmates’ bullying,” she said.Jiang said that every year, her primary school would hold class sessions where teachers would teach students the Party’s propaganda about Falun Gong, which vilified the practice as a dangerous cult. “When the teacher was saying bad things about Falun Gong on stage, my classmates would also join in,” she said. “It really tormented my heart, I was shouting inside that Falun Gong is not like this, it’s the Chinese Communist Party persecuting us and blackening us.”Because of the fear and the pressure, Jiang said she didn’t invite any friends to their home.She said that when Beijing hosted the 2008 Olympics, local authorities also stepped up their persecution.“Every time my mom went to pick me up from school or every time we went out, we always had to look around to make sure no one was following us,” she said. “Every evening when I heard someone walking up the [apartment building] stairs, I would panic. The louder the footsteps the more panicky I became.”Falun Gong practitioner Jane Dai at the United Nations Plaza in New York, N.Y., on Sept. 24, 2019. (Eva Fu/The Epoch Times)Jane Dai, whose husband was persecuted to death in China, said she hopes her daughter can lead a “normal life” now in the United States.Dai’s husband was imprisoned, tortured, and died in 2001. The last time her daughter, now 19, saw her father’s face, was when she was nine months old.“She said that she was very curious how it feels like to have a father,” Dai said.Dai said that she only fully realized how her daughter lacked a normal childhood when she observed one day a boy chasing pigeons in the park. “I never saw my daughter like that, with that kind of innocent joy.”“Twenty years of persecution … It’s too long for one generation to endure all of this,” she added.Jiang said that she couldn’t hold back the tears as she sat meditating at the UN Plaza.“The practitioners in China are still suffering from persecution,” she said. “I have to do my part.”]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[China’s 20-Year ‘Four Asian Tigers’ Economic Development Model Is Coming to an End]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F26%2F47%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese leader Xi Jinping attends a meeting during the 10th BRICS summit (meeting of the world's leading emerging economies, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) in Johannesburg, South Africa, on July 26, 2018. (Gulshan Khan/AFP/Getty Images) Commentary In the past 20 years, China’s economy has experienced tremendous growth by replicating the success model of the “Four Asian Tigers”—South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. China’s exports to the West grew exponentially at that time. However, this development model is coming to an end as China’s economic growth has slowed due to the tariff war with the United States. Washington has also called on Beijing to reform its unfair trade practices. China’s dream of being the world’s second largest economy will soon dissipate unless it makes structural economic reform.The ‘Four Asian Tigers’ Economic ModelFrom 1970 to 1990, the United States and other western developed countries began to outsource labor-intensive industries to developing countries. The “Four Asian Tigers,” also known as “Asian Dragons,” immediately seized this opportunity and took advantage of their cheap labor force to attract foreign capital and technology. By forming a large-scale export processing industry, these four countries—South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore—enjoyed thriving economies. Their highest annual economic growth rates were close to 10 percent during their prime time.By 1990, per capita GDPs of these countries were: $13,486 for Hong Kong; $12,766 for Singapore; $8,124 for Taiwan; and $6,514 for South Korea. As a reference, the world’s average per capita GDP at the time was $4,270. The success of these four countries became a classic case for economic research.In 1989, the “Four Asian Tigers” were considered emerging developed countries, and thus the United States terminated their Most Favored Nation (MFN) status. This brought an end to their rapid growth, and they transitioned to a normal development stage. The success of the “Four Asian Tigers” has served as a role model for other Asian countries. When China started its economic reform and opening up of its markets, it attempted to replicate this development model.The 40-Year Delay in China’s Economic DevelopmentWhen World War II ended in 1945, almost all countries involved in the war immediately entered a post-war reconstruction stage and worked hard on economic development. After the United States helped China win the Sino-Japanese War, China’s then-Kuomintang government was also preparing to rebuild China’s economy.However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) launched a war against the Kuomintang shortly after Japanese troops surrendered. At that time, the Kuomintang army was exhausted after more than ten years of fighting the Japanese. The CCP, instead of helping drive out the Japanese invaders from China, had reserved its main forces by moving around and hiding, but seldom attacking the enemy. In addition, the CCP gave away railroad and seaport rights, and factory resources to the Soviet Union in exchange for all the weapons the Japanese troops had surrendered to then-Soviet leader Stalin. All of this resulted in the Kuomintang losing the civil war, and being forced to retreat to the island of Taiwan in 1949.Communist troops in the Chinese civil war.

(Public Domain)After the CCP seized power and established the People’s Republic of China in 1949, one would think that it would have focused on economic development. However, the CCP insisted on having to participate in the Korean War, causing the deaths and injuries of nearly one million soldiers. In addition, China treated the United Nations Command (UNC)—the multinational military force supporting South Korea—as its enemy. Therefore, China closed its doors to all the UNC member nations after the war was over. The Soviet Union was China’s only friend to offer some assistance, while North Korea looked to China for help to sustain itself.Domestically, the CCP launched one political movement after another, creating terror in society and eliminating millions of so-called “class enemies,” such as the capitalists, landowners and intellectuals.In addition, Deng Xiaoping launched a war against Vietnam in 1979 for attacking Cambodia, China’s ally. With the support of the former Soviet Union, Vietnam launched a large-scale attack on Cambodia on Dec. 25, 1978, overthrowing the Khmer Rouge regime that promoted Maoism in the country.While China was busy carrying out these violent political movements and waging a war with Vietnam, the “Four Asian Tigers” were in a period of rapid economic development.The CCP also initiated what looked like economic activities, such as “The People’s Communes” and “The Great Leap Forward,” but in reality, they were political movements. While carrying out these two movements, the CCP and the Soviet Union clashed over socialist views. As a result, the two countries became hostile towards each other and tense relations led to the Sino-Soviet split (1956-1966). Because the Soviet Union had a one-million member army and could easily wage a war against China at any time, the CCP leaders were forced to evacuate from Beijing.At this critical moment, the United States decided to intervene. The Nixon administration threatened to fight a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, and thus helped the CCP avert the crisis.For more than 40 years—from the end of World War II in 1945 to 1987 when the CCP officially announced it would focus on economic development as its central task—the Chinese economy lagged far behind other countries.‘Four Asian Tigers’ Model Becomes the CCP’s LifelineThe CCP decided to focus on economic development because it realized that if China continued its impoverished situation, the Chinese people would demand that the CCP step down from power.However, having lagged behind for more than 40 years, China had great difficulties making any progress without the support of foreign capital or technology. The United States came to the rescue again in 2001, when the Clinton administration persuaded its Western allies to accept China into the World Trade Organization (WTO). Former president Bill Clinton mistakenly believed that China’s economic development would automatically bring about political reforms, and China would move towards democracy and the rule of law.

(Peter Rogers/Getty Image)The United States also granted China MFN status as a developing country, and the world opened its markets to China, injected funds and provided technology, and allowed a 15-year protective transition period. The CCP was overjoyed and immediately pledged to commit to all the terms required by the WTO.The golden opportunity that was once given to the “Four Asian Tigers” was suddenly bestowed on China. It meant that the CCP was unexpectedly thrown a lifeline by the United States while struggling in the midst of political and economic crises.The CCP’s Head SwellsBy replicating the “Four Asian Tigers” model, China’s export-oriented economy experienced rapid growth in the past two decades. At the early stage, entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Taiwan established manufacturing bases in China. Subsequently, the United States and Europe soon followed.Shortly after the CCP had seized power, it imposed an overly strict household registration system, which prevented the rural population from becoming urban residents. As a result, there was an oversupply of labor in China’s countryside, but these peasants were mostly unemployed and impoverished with no way out.It was completely beyond the CCP’s wildest dreams that this discriminatory policy would turn out to provide the main workforce for China’s economic development. Since then, migrant peasants have been working hard in foreign-funded companies for very little pay, but still they were happy about these job opportunities, and few people from this group ever challenged the CCP’s unfair household registration system.What made the CCP even more excited was the huge amount of U.S. dollars and euros it collected from exports. The CCP pocketed most of the foreign currency, and printed large quantities of Chinese yuan to be issued to export enterprises.The “Four Asian Tigers” model has become the CCP’s golden goose. Communist Chinese officials from all levels accepted bribes from the entrepreneurs in the export sector, thus making them very rich.The profits from exports, combined with foreign investments, resulted in an over-issuance of currency in China. Subsequently, money was first injected into infrastructure projects, followed by the stock market, the real estate market, and presently into a highly deformed capital market as well as the IT industry. At each turn, opportunities kept arising for massive corruption. The CCP’s “red families” have all become billionaires.The economic development model copied from the “Four Asian Tigers” has proven to be really effective. The CCP has also launched huge export subsidies, expanded production capacity and boosted exports by dumping, hoping for a continuous flow of U.S. dollars into their pockets.In 2018, China’s total import and export volume reached $4.5 trillion, accounting for one third of its GDP. Meanwhile, the trade surplus was at $419.2 billion with the United States, and 184 billion euros with the EU. It made the CCP’s head swell, and it thought the “Four Asian Tigers” economic model could be sustained for a long time.The CCP’s ‘Number Two Superpower’ DreamWith huge amounts of U.S. dollars coming into the country, the CCP started to dream about being the “number two superpower” in the world.It began to heavily invest in military weapons. If a weapon could be bought, the CCP would buy it. If no country was willing to sell a certain weapon or equipment, the CCP would try to steal the technology. It began to copy the U.S. military model, attempting to become the number one military power in Asia first, and later a world military giant, hoping to one day be able to defeat the United States.Politically, the CCP continues to spend money to win votes from developing countries in the United Nations. At the same time, it infiltrates the United States and European countries through its large-scale overseas propaganda and spy networks, and tries to seduce Western politicians with money and various types of benefits.Economically, the CCP launched its high-profile “One Belt, One Road” initiative which in essence is the CCP’s ambition to create a new type of colonialism, and a solution to its overcapacity problem. In addition, the CCP upholds the banner of globalization, hoping to maintain its export-oriented economy.In the field of technology, the CCP launched the “Made in 2025” plan, deploying every type of trade theft tactic in various industries. Chinese tech giants ZTE and Huawei, both disguised as private enterprises, attempt to defeat competitors through super low prices. And they are able to do so because they receive huge subsidies from the Chinese regime every year. Their goal is to become the leaders in the international market, and in turn, take further control of the telecommunications industry in Western countries.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Just when the CCP was immersed in its “number two superpower” dream, the United States gave it a sudden blow by waging a tariff war. Both U.S. politicians and citizens have started to realize that granting China MFN status and allowing it to reproduce the economic success of the “Four Asian Tigers” did not help bring about a change toward democracy and human rights.On the contrary, the CCP made a huge fortune from its MFN status, but refused to fulfill any of the promises it made when joining the WTO. For instance, when China opens its market to a developed country, it should not be on the condition of handing over technology. Furthermore, under WTO terms, China is required to stop intellectual property infringement, reduce export subsidies, reduce the market share of state-owned enterprises, and open its telecommunications market.To put it plainly, Western countries have been utterly fooled by the CCP.The United States started to correct its mistakes in March 2018. The Trump administration hoped to rectify the trade imbalance with China through negotiations. The CCP, of course, ignored the requests for structural reform. As a result, a tariff war has broken out and has become more and more intense. China’s economy is taking a hit.It was only at this point that the CCP realized that its path of replicating the “Four Asian Tigers” economic model had come to an end. The era of pocketing huge sums of U.S. dollars is gone. Supply chains are leaving China. The CCP’s “number two superpower” dream is over.Now the Chinese people have discovered that the economic achievements of the “Reform and Opening Up” era were merely that the CCP had imitated the “Four Asian Tigers” model. The four Asian countries, after the rapid growth stage, gradually got out of the export-oriented development model, and achieved industrial upgrading, which helped them to become more competitive in the international market. They are now in a new development stage by being a responsible member in the international community.Is the CCP willing to integrate into the international economic order? Obviously not. Structural economic reform is the only solution for China’s future development, and it has become a pressing issue. But the CCP, afraid of losing power, only hopes to continue on, and shows no respect for the principles of economic development and ignores ethical standards in international trade. On such a course, not only will the CCP lose the opportunity to become the “number two superpower,” but it is also ruining the opportunity for China to continue its growth by implementing economic reform. Will the Chinese people put up with it?]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[China Develops Portable Sonic Weapon for Crowd Control]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F26%2F46%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Riot police fire rubber bullet at protesters in Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong, on Aug. 24, 2019. (Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) recently announced that it has developed the world’s first hand-held sonic weapon, and will soon enter mass production for police crowd control. The announcement was made in an online report from the academy’s Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry (TIPC) on Sept. 18. The specific name of the research project was “portable low frequency high decibel focused acoustic device in crowd dispersion for police use.”It is one of the top ten national key R&amp;D programs launched in November 2016, according to the report.The instrument, jointly developed with research teams from the Chinese military and Ministry of Public Security, passed third-party testing and field testing on Sept. 4. The development was verified as “an independent innovation,” the TIPC reported.However, the entire report was later removed from TIPC’s website. Sonic weapons use sound waves to injure, incapacitate, or kill an opponent. There are two major categories of sonic weapons: those that involve audible frequencies and those that are either ultrasonic or infrasonic and are inaudible to humans.TIPC’s project name suggests that the sound generated by this portable weapon is likely infrasound (low frequency). According to a Sept. 25 article from Popular Mechanics, infrasound’s effects on the human inner ear include, “vertigo, imbalance, intolerable sensations, incapacitation, disorientation, nausea, vomiting, bowel spasm; and resonances in inner organs, such as the heart.”Traditional infrasonic weapons are typically bulky units, and are most commonly used for crowd control and repelling pirates.Flesh-burning Laser RiflePreviously, China claimed to have developed a laser gun that burns flesh from half a mile away.In an Aug. 2018 article, Phoenix News, a Hong Kong-based pro-Beijing publication, described this star-wars like laser rifle, ZKZM-500, as a powerful weapon that can instantly cause serious flesh burns and set flammable fabrics on fire, inflicting pain “beyond human endurance.” The laser beams can even penetrate windows to attack the target.Despite the horrific damaging effects, the Phoenix article emphasized repeatedly that this laser gun is a non-lethal weapon and will first of all be used as riot gear for China’s armed police.In addition, China does not plan to export this powerful laser gun. The only users will be the Chinese military and law enforcers, the article said.Chinese Regime Is ‘Modern Nazi Organization Equipped with High-Tech’&nbsp;Zheng Haochang, a U.S.-based commentator on current affairs, told the Chinese-language Epoch Times that high-tech riot weapons have always been used by Western countries to combat terrorists, but in China, the regime’s main focus is quelling dissidents.“Especially at the present time, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) feels very insecure about its power, and the suppression of dissidents has continued to escalate over the years.”In addition, the damaging effects of sonic weapons are not readily visible. “From this perspective, a portable sonic gun can cause extensive damage without leaving any traces. The witnesses will have difficulty proving the injuries they suffered. Chinese civilians are at a bigger risk when the CCP deploys this type of weapon to quell dissidents,” Zheng added.Li Da, an automation engineer working in the United States, told the Chinese-language Epoch Times that the CCP has been trying to control China’s 1.4 billion Chinese people by developing high-tech weapons, police equipment, and surveillance technology on a large scale in recent years.As far as he knows, the CCP also uses biological weapons that destroy liver cells and eventually kill pro-democracy activists. “The CCP is already a modern Nazi organization equipped with high-tech,” Li said.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Senate Passes Bill Condemning China’s Human Rights Abuses in Xinjiang]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F13%2F45%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Uyghur men walking past the exit of an underpass after attending Eid al-Fitr prayers, marking the end of Ramadan, in Kashgar in China's northwest Xinjiang region on June 5, 2019. (Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images) The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan bill aimed at countering the Chinese regime’s human rights abuses in the Muslim-practicing region of Xinjiang in the country’s northwest. The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which passed the senate on Sept. 11, calls on the U.S. administration to consider whether to sanction Chinese officials involved in the crackdown on Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the region. It also urges the the Commerce Department to consider banning the sale of US goods and services to state agents in Xinjiang. A facility believed to be a re-education camp where mostly Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, in Artux, north of Kashgar in China’s western Xinjiang region, on June 2, 2019. (Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images) The Chinese regime, in a purported effort to combat extremism, has detained more than 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in internment camps in the region, according to estimates by the U.S. State Department and experts. Millions of residents in Xinjiang are also under heavy surveillance implemented through a dense network of cameras, frequent security checks, and biodata collections. Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the bill’s lead sponsors, applauded its passage as “an important step in countering the totalitarian Chinese government’s widespread and horrific human rights abuses” in the region. “It’s long overdue for the United States to hold Chinese government and Communist Party officials accountable for the systemic and egregious human rights abuses and probable crimes against humanity in Xinjiang,” Rubio said in a joint statement on Sept. 11. The bill would require the Director of National Intelligence to provide a report detailing the national security threat posed by the crackdown, including a list of the Chinese companies involved in the construction and operation of the internment camps. It would also require the Secretary of State to provide a report to Congress on whether certain Chinese officials overseeing the Xinjiang region could be held accountable under the Global Magnitsky Act. That Act allows for sanctions against individuals who commit human rights violations, including freezing their U.S. assets and barring them from entry to the United States. “This legislation makes clear that Congress will not turn a blind eye as millions of Uyghur Muslims are unjustly imprisoned, subjected to a mass surveillance state, and forced into labor camps by an autocratic regime,” Menendez said. Companion legislation was introduced to the House of Representatives in January. Beijing on Sep. 12 protested the move as “flagrant interference” in the country’s domestic affairs, and demanded that the U.S. to “stop pushing the bill” to “prevent damages to the overall relationship between China and the US.” Washington-based nonprofit Uyghur Human Rights Project, in a Sept. 12 statement, welcomed the bill’s passage, saying it was the “first legislation passed by any nation” responding to the Xinjiang “nightmare,” and sends a powerful message to Beijing.

    <title><![CDATA[Hong Kong Authorities Conceal Evidence of Police Brutality That Caused Alleged Deaths of Protesters, Witnesses Say]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F13%2F44%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Some Hongkongers mourning at Prince Edward Station, Hong Kong to commemorate the victims of the violence on Aug. 31, 2019. After allegations surfaced that several protesters had lost their lives due to police violence at a Hong Kong train station on Aug. 31, the city’s MTR (Mass Transit Railway) Corporation released video screenshots from surveillance cameras to quell public concerns. However, some believe that the most crucial footage of the violent incident was deliberately omitted, and the allegations are persisting. Riot police stormed MTR trains at Prince Edward station and made many arrests on the evening of Aug. 31. Witnesses say the police assaulted passengers indiscriminately, chasing and beating them with batons on the platform and using pepper spray in train carriages. Several people were hit on the head and bleeding heavily. The train station then announced that due to a serious incident inside the station, the train service was suspended, and passengers had to transfer to another train heading to Shek Kip Mei Station. Since then, there have been a number of claims circulating on the internet alleging that police violence at the train station resulted in protesters’ deaths. The exact number of deaths is unknown. Authorities have repeatedly denied the allegations. Meanwhile, locals continue to leave flowers at the entrance to the station to commemorate the deceased victims. MTR Releases Surveillance Photos but Omits Critical Footage Police raided Prince Edward station shortly after a train arrived at 11:10 p.m. on Aug. 31. Violence continued for nearly two hours until most passengers were transferred to another train, and seven injured passengers were taken to Lai Chi Kok station. Hong Kong’s rail operator, the MTR Corporation, was urged by some concerned citizens and lawmakers to release surveillance footage from that night to address public concerns. The company’s response came ten days later, releasing only stills from CCTV (closed circuit television) cameras on Sept. 10, with the excuse that “passengers’ privacy concerns must be taken into account.” Moreover, the most critical time frame when riot police assaulted the passengers was completely missing from the CCTV release. MTR’s Chief of Operations Sammy Wong explained that the footage may not be “comprehensive” as three of the surveillance cameras were damaged. Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, pointed out that the release of selected screenshots fell short of addressing public concerns. “The MTR will have to release a complete CCTV video to be able to clear up the doubts,” Mo said. The Hong Kong government owns more than 70 percent of the MTR shares. Protesters claim that MTR has cooperated with police multiple times, placing the protesters in a perilous situation. This was verified by one witness who spoke with a reporter from the Chinese language edition of The Epoch Times during an anti-extradition bill rally on Sept. 2. The witness, named Huy, said that MTR shut off the escalator inside the Prince Edward station after police stormed in, making it very difficult for passengers to exit. Two Videos Released by Journalist Alvin Ilum, a journalist working for the South China Morning Post, posted two videos on Twitter on Sept. 10 that were recorded on the evening of Aug. 31 at Yau Ma Tei station and Lai Chi Kok station. In the Yau Ma Tei station video, three injured individuals were taken away, one of them was carried away on a stretcher. All three had bandages around their heads. In the Lai Chi Kok station video, which Alvin Ilum claimed he obtained from a witness with exclusive rights, seven ambulances arrived at the station to take people to the hospital between 1 a.m. and 1:50 a.m. on Sept. 1. Testimonies and Information Provided by Locals On Sept. 5, Ms. Leung, the director of Kwun Tong Community posted a message on Hong Kong’s social news website LIHKG Forum—often referred to as Hong Kong’s version of Reddit—saying: “A neighbor of mine came over to tell me that police caused six deaths at Prince Edward station. He learned the information from his friend working at a mortuary service who told him that all these six people died from broken necks, and apparently the police twisted their necks harshly 90 degrees from behind to cause the deaths.” There is also a video that has been circulating on Chinese social media and uploaded on&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;which shows a man and a woman being interviewed by an English-speaking journalist. The woman was leaving funeral offerings at the Prince Edward station when the journalist approached her for an interview. She said emotionally that her friend died from the violence on Aug. 31. When she tried to console the friend’s parents, she found out that the two elderly people had been placed under house arrest after they went to the mortuary to claim the corpse. “Presently we cannot even reach them by phone!” the woman said in Cantonese, and her male friend helped to translate it into English for the journalist. Many medical professionals staged a sit-in on Sept. 1 to protest against police brutality. One Hong Kong netizen posted on Facebook that doctors and nurses wanted to protest because they are at the frontline of urgent care, and many of them have already learned about the deaths at the train station. The netizen also revealed what a policewoman said to a group of mourners. On Sept. 6, while a group of protesters were burning joss paper—fake paper money for the dead—at the station, a policewoman spilled the beans when she came over to comfort them, saying “I understand that you are mourning those deceased [anti-extradition bill] protesters.” A male police who was close by heard what she said and immediately tried to correct her. “There was no death,” he said. But his cover-up only made it more suspicious, according to the netizen. In addition, three young people told the Chinese-language Epoch Times on the condition of anonymity that they lost contact with two friends after the violent incident at Prince Edward station on Aug. 31. “We used to communicate with one another almost every day. Two friends have been missing since Aug. 31. We tried to look for them through several different channels, but no one knows of their whereabouts.”]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[China Involved in a Quarter of Significant Cyber Incidents in Past Year, Report Says]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F13%2F43%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[One quarter of significant cyberattacks&nbsp;over the last 12 months were perpetrated from China, according to data from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). The Washington-based think tank monitors cyberattacks on government agencies, defense and tech companies, or economic crimes with losses of over $1 million. Its latest global compilation of the cyberattacks over the past 12 months from the China accounted for 28 of the 113 incidents. In addition, a recent CSIS report (pdf) titled “Emerging Technologies and Managing the Risk of Tech Transfer to China” warned that despite deep interconnections between individuals, companies, and civilian agencies in China and the United States, “China’s government and some Chinese companies will use any means, legal or illegal, to acquire technology.” “China is a determined, well-resourced, and persistent cyber-adversary,” the report said. Despite a 2015 agreement between China and the United States to stop cyber-espionage for commercial purposes by state actors, Chinese cyber espionage and the theft of IP continue to cost the United States tens of billions of dollars annually, the report noted. Unlike most cyberattacks that tend to emanate from criminal elements operating in other nations, the report said that the majority of China cyberattacks were performed by state-sponsored intelligence actors to obtain information on emerging technologies identified as strategic priorities by the Chinese regime, including telecommunications, healthcare, semiconductor manufacturing, and machine learning. Given that “innovation is the cornerstone of future power,” CSIS said that “what was tolerable when China was a developing economy is no longer acceptable, particularly now that it is the second-largest economy in the world and a military competitor.” China cyberattacks are increasingly integrated into “official collection programs with efforts by individuals, companies, and civilian agencies,” the report said. Instead of relying on intelligence officers operating undercover, China state-actors also recruit businessmen, researchers, and students studying and working in the US to acquire information. The report suggested the United States mitigate such risks by using “regulation, negotiation, and measures to protect intellectual property.” It also recommended modernized technology transfer restrictions on emerging technologies, similar to restrictions on foreign investment contained in the&nbsp;Foreign Investment Risk and Review Modernization Act (FIRMMA) modernized. The report’s specific recommendations include: Create new end-user controls focused on the Chinese government and military recipients for emerging technology; Work with allies to limit Chinese investments that provide access to or control of emerging technologies; Modernize export controls to move away from Cold War-style control performance thresholds; and Increase FBI funding for counterintelligence activities. It suggested reaffirming&nbsp;National Security Directive NSDD-189 protections for fundamental research. The Reagan-era directive established a national policy for controlling the flow of science, technology, and engineering information produced in federally-funded fundamental research at colleges, universities, and laboratories. CSIS did not support a ban on Chinese workers and students, but noted that additional scrutiny was necessary for “graduate students in research areas with potential military applications or against “minders”—individuals sent to keep an eye on other Chinese students.”]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F08%2F42%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[近日，北京維權律師倪玉蘭夫婦，再次遭到西城區國保跨地區逼遷。（本人提供） 近日，住在北京通州的人權律師倪玉蘭夫婦，再次遭到西城區國保跨地區逼遷，一家已簽約的中介公司迫於壓力欲解除合同，使得倪玉蘭夫婦面臨著無錢租房，無處安身的困境。 倪玉蘭對大紀元記者說，8月29日，她們與前一家中介公司合同到期，27日，她們與接續的另一家中介公司已簽好了協議，繼續租賃現住的房子。但在28日，警察威脅中介公司強迫她們退房。 「好不容易借了一萬多塊錢，把前期的租金先交上了，讓我們再租房，我們也沒錢啊？」倪玉蘭說，「我的家被他們強拆，去維權，他們就定我們是上訪人，說上訪人就是跟政府作對的。」 「我們沒有房子住，肯定得到處去租房子，還是被他們控制，然後又逼著中介驅趕我們，每一次我們都要向外交官求助。一個正經的政府官員做事，應該本著安民守法為主，我們自己找住處，他們還要找麻煩。如果沒有好處，他們會這麼做嗎？」 倪玉蘭說，據身邊的朋友說，這些專門做逼遷的警察被稱作「房蟲子」，他們就是利用這種方式，從中介及租戶身上撈取好處費。 「北京的房租非常貴，整天過著膽戰心驚的日子，（國保）每天深更半夜一二點鍾砸門，都嚇出心臟病了。」「我們願意自己有個家，而他們給強拆了，為什麼不給我們安置補償？」倪玉蘭氣憤地說。 倪玉蘭原本應該享有退休金，但所有手續均被當局控制，斷絕了生活來源，全家只靠老伴兒的退休金生活，除了3,000多元的房租金，扣除水電費，餘額連生活都不能保障，女兒也不斷遭到國保騷擾，只能打點兒零工維生。 倪玉蘭於1978年考入北京語言學院，在中文系獲本科學位，後來又獲得中國政法大學的本科學位。1986年開始從事律師工作，曾在中國國際貿易總公司擔任法律顧問、正義律師事務所擔任律師。 而如今的倪玉蘭只能在輪椅上坐著，原本是律師的她曾幫助很多因強拆被迫流離失所的人維權，沒想到她自己的家，也於2008年北京奧運籌辦期間被政府強拆，未得到安置補償，倪玉蘭從一名維權律師變成了為自己維權。 十幾年來，當局通過騷擾、多次拘捕、判監、酷刑等手段，阻止她們全家進行維權，在被拘押期間，倪玉蘭受到酷刑折磨，幾次險些喪命，雙腿被打殘，需要以輪椅代步。 早在2002年4月，北京申奧成功後，倪玉蘭因圍觀鄰居家遭強拆時拍攝照片而被抓捕，11月27日，以「妨礙公務罪」被判刑一年，同時被吊銷律師執照。 2003年出獄後，她開始為自己維權上訪，因而遭遇更大的迫害。 2008年，倪玉蘭位於西城區的家遭到了數次強拆，倪玉蘭再次被抓到派出所，12月18日，北京市西城區法院以「妨害公務罪」，判處倪玉蘭有期徒刑二年。 被關押期間，她遭受酷刑虐待，被五花大綁地捆起來之後，繩子還要往上拉，可聽見「肋骨嘎巴嘎巴響」；她被人用膝蓋死死擠壓住身上的各個穴位，表面上不露痕跡，卻疼痛得讓人生不如死；警察還用摔碎的水杯碎片割她，割了很多次，乃至很多年之後才能康復，她雙腿被打殘，至今無法站立。 2012年4月，她再度被以「尋釁滋事」和「詐騙」罪名判刑二年八個月，而她的丈夫董繼勤也被以「尋釁滋事」罪名判刑二年。 2017年4月，一群男子闖入她西城租住的房屋內，將她與丈夫以及女兒拖出住所，強行押送到通州，他們一家在寒冷的冬天被迫露宿街頭，無家可歸，且持續遭到公安監視，境遇悲慘。 倪玉蘭曾經榮獲荷蘭鬱金香人權捍衛獎，她曾感言，慘無人道的迫害，給我和我的家人造成了巨大的傷害，面對邪惡，殘忍的酷刑不能讓我屈服，殘酷折磨不能喪失我的堅強意志。]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[China Lodges Tariff Case at WTO Against the US]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F08%2F41%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The World Trade Organization headquarters in Geneva on April 12, 2018. (Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images) HONG KONG/GENEVA—China has lodged a complaint against the United States at the World Trade Organization over U.S. import duties, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said on Sept. 2. The United States began imposing 15 percent tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods on Sunday and China began imposing new duties on U.S. crude oil, the latest escalation in their trade war. China did not release details of its legal case but said the U.S. tariffs affected $300 billion of Chinese exports. The Commerce Ministry said the latest tariff actions violated the consensus reached by leaders of China and the United States in a meeting in Osaka, Japan. China will defend its legal rights in accordance with WTO rules, it said. The lawsuit is the third Beijing has brought to challenge U.S. President Donald Trump’s China-specific tariffs at the WTO, the international organization that limits the tariffs each country is allowed to charge. U.S. officials say that they are penalizing China for theft of intellectual property that is not covered by WTO rules, although many trade experts say that any tariff hike above the allowed maximum must be justified at the WTO. Many experts also decry China’s decision to fight fire with fire, by imposing tariffs on U.S. goods imported into China, also without the WTO’s approval. On Friday the United States published a written defense in the first of the three legal cases, asserting that China and the United States agreed the issue should not be judged at the WTO. “China has taken the unilateral decision to adopt aggressive industrial policy measures to steal or otherwise unfairly acquire the technology of its trading partners; the United States has adopted tariff measures to try to obtain the elimination of China’s unfair and distortive technology-transfer policies,” it said. China had chosen to respond not by addressing U.S. concerns but with its own tariffs, “in an effort to maintain its unfair policies indefinitely.” The U.S. submission also said its actions were exempt from WTO rules because they were “measures necessary to protect public morals”—a clause used in the past to argue for trade restrictions over gambling, animal rights and public broadcasting. Under WTO rules, Washington has 60 days to try to settle the latest dispute. Then China could ask the WTO to adjudicate, a process that would take several years. It could end with China gaining WTO approval to take trade sanctions, if the United States is found to have broken the rules. By Meg Shen and Tom Miles]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Australian Think Tank Report Reveals Details About China’s Twitter Disinformation Campaign Targeting Hong Kong Protests]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F08%2F40%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Protesters take part in a school boycott rally at Tamer Park in Central district in Hong Kong on Sept. 2, 2019. (Chris McGrath/Getty Images) An investigation by an Australian think tank found that Beijing bought Twitter spam accounts to spread misleading information about not just the Hong Kong protests, but also multiple events dating as far back as 2015. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a nonpartisan defense and strategic policy think tank, recently released a report analyzing Twitter accounts the company suspended in August and their 3.6 million tweets, which were published between December 2007 and May 2019. In a blog post on Aug. 19, Twitter announced that it had suspended 936 accounts originating from China that were “deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground.” The company also released data related to those accounts. Hongkongers have staged mass protests since June in opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would allow the Chinese regime to seek extradition of individuals to be trialed in mainland China, where there is no rule of law. ASPI found that “the amount of content directly targeting the Hong Kong protests makes up only a relatively small fraction of the total dataset released by Twitter, comprising just 112 accounts and approximately 1,600 tweets, of which the vast majority are in Chinese with a much smaller number in English,” the report stated. The report surmised that due to the predominant use of the Chinese language in those tweets, their target audiences were likely Hongkongers and the overseas Chinese diaspora. Twitter is banned inside mainland China. Aside from Hong Kong, the report found that the accounts were involved in past operations, including attacking Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong bookseller who was abducted by Chinese authorities in 2015 for publishing books critical of Chinese leadership. In 2018, those accounts posted messages attacking Chinese human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng. Campaign The Chinese information campaign targeting Hong Kong protests was “hastily constructed” and “blunt,” relying on repurposed spam and marketing accounts to disseminate information. According to the report, the accounts are usually easily and cheaply purchased from online resellers. There was no “sophisticated coordination” among the actors behind these Twitter accounts, indicating that the campaign wasn’t planned in advance. “Many of the accounts we looked at were very ‘spammy’ and could clearly be picked out as they didn’t look like real people,” Tom Uren, senior analyst in cybersecurity at ASPI and one of the authors of the report, said in an email interview with The Epoch Times. The report stated, “This was the quintessential authoritarian approach to influence—one-way floods of messaging, primarily at Hongkongers.” Due to the quick pace of events unfolding in Hong Kong, it likely made it more difficult for Beijing to build up an “influence infrastructure,” leading to them relying on existing accounts, according to the report. Uren said the report findings are significant because it shows that China is among “a list of states we know are trying to covertly manipulate Western social media: Russia, Iran, and now China.” Uren offered suggestions on how to fend off influence operations, including by making advertising and political donations transparent on social media platforms, and establishing standards of cooperation with social networks. Hong Kong The report noted that influence operations related to the Hong Kong protests began on April 14, when an account named @HKpoliticalnew posted a tweet about the extradition bill. On June 14, there was a significant spike in the number of tweets published by the 112 accounts that ASPI analyzed as part of the Hong Kong influence campaign. June 9 marked the start of mass protests, when more than 1 million people took to the streets to call for the bill to be withdrawn from consideration by the city legislature. Then on June 12, peaceful protests descended into chaos at around 3 p.m. local time, after some protesters tried to break through police lines outside the legislature building. Local police used tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and bean bags in an attempt to clear protestors from the streets. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam suspended the bill indefinitely on June 15. On Sept. 4, she announced that the bill would be formally withdrawn, but protesters said they would continue to appeal for their other demands, including an independent commission to investigate instances of police violence. Another tweeting spike took place July 1, when roughly 550,000 took to the streets, according to march organizers. The ASPI report found that tweets in English also began that day, possibly in response to international attention on the events in Hong Kong. The report summarized that there were three main narratives from the tweets: condemnation of the Hong Kong protesters; support for the Hong Kong police and “rule of law”; and a conspiracy theory about Western governments fomenting the protests. Beijing has consistently pushed this narrative since it spoke publicly about the protests in July. For example, one tweet read: “‘Hong Kong SAR [special administrative region] police headquarters were surrounded and attacked. Who were the people wearing black? They were acting under the direction of western anti-China forces. They’re manipulating things behind the scenes.” Follow Frank on Twitter: @HwaiDer]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Germany’s Merkel Says Hong Kong’s Rights Should Be Protected]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F08%2F39%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (L) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel (C) inspect an honor guard during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China on Sept. 6, 2019. (Roman Pilipey/Pool Photo via AP) BEIJING–German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sept. 6 that the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents should be protected, adding that a solution to the Chinese city’s political crisis can only be achieved through dialogue and that violence should be avoided. Merkel met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing, where the German leader faces the challenge of balancing human rights concerns and economic discussions with one of Germany’s largest trading partners. “I indicated during the talks that the rights and freedoms agreed upon in Hong Kong’s Basic Law should be safeguarded,” Merkel said during a joint news briefing with Li. The Basic Law is Hong Kong’s de facto constitution, which promises the semi-autonomous Chinese city certain democratic rights not afforded to the mainland. Merkel added that political dialogue—not violence—is the path toward a resolution. China was Germany’s biggest single trading partner last year, with trade totaling 199 billion euros ($218 billion). The relationship is important to Europe’s largest economy, particularly as Germany is considered likely to enter a technical recession in the current quarter. Germany long had amicable relations with Beijing because its exporters ran a surplus supplying Chinese factories with equipment and components. But those ties increasingly are strained over German complaints about market access and Chinese technology policy. Li told reporters during the joint briefing that German companies are welcome in China. He and Merkel discussed collaboration on artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles, as well as intellectual property rights and reducing export controls, Li said. Beijing has previously tried without success to recruit Germany as an ally in its tariff war with the United States. Merkel’s government has echoed U.S. complaints over China’s unfair trade practices. Merkel is in Beijing with a high-ranking German business delegation that includes executives in the auto, financial services and transport industries. In recent years, German companies have been unhappy about being barred from acquiring most Chinese assets at a time when China’s companies have been on a global buying spree. Among the agreements signed on Friday was one between Germany’s StreetScooter and China’s Chery Holding, two electric vehicle companies. StreetScooter, owned by logistics giant Deutsche Post DHL, has already overtaken established German car companies in selling electric utility vans, and the new partnership could give it access to the massive Chinese market and boost its limited production capacity. The economic ties make it harder for Merkel to satisfy a U.S. diplomat and activists who have urged her to raise human rights issues such as China’s treatment of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as the three months of pro-democracy demonstrations that have roiled Hong Kong. Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, said Thursday that China’s “willful disregard of its commitments” to Hong Kong and human rights violations in Xinjiang show that its ruling Communist Party “stands against the values Germany cherishes.” “We hope that Chancellor Merkel will take a firm stance for the values that unified Germany after the fall of Communism: human rights, democracy and the rule of law,” he said. Protestors cover their right eye during a rally against the violence in Hong Kong and the Chinese regime, in front of the chancellery in Berlin, Germany on Sept. 5, 2019. The protestors demand the support of German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the protest movement in Hong Kong. (Markus Schreiber/AP) Hong Kong activists also warned Merkel about dealing with “authoritarian and unjust regimes” in an open letter published this week in Germany’s Bild newspaper. On the question of what Merkel might say about Hong Kong, a senior German official said the talks with Xi and Li will be conducted “comprehensively in terms of thematic breadth, and open and friendly in terms of tone—with a readiness to express criticism where we think things are worthy of criticism.” The official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity in line with department rules. China has bristled at what it calls foreign interference from countries such as the United States and the UK in political tumult in Hong Kong, where activists have staged three months of mass protests calling for democratic reforms and an independent inquiry into police conduct. Merkel travels Saturday to Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei Province, where she will inaugurate the plant expansion at German auto supplier Webasto and speak at Wuhan University.

    <title><![CDATA[Hong Kong Nurse Describes Protesters’ Fractured Hand Due to Police Brutality]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F02%2F38%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Police arrest a man during protests in Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong on Aug. 11, 2019. (Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images) More than 700 people have been arrested by Hong Kong police since demonstrations began in June protesting a proposed bill that would allow Beijing to extradite suspects to the mainland for processing. Many feared it would expose Hong Kong residents, and even visitors, to a judicial system controlled by communist China, and would further erode Hong Kong’s autonomous status. Local media recently reported that some protesters taken by police have suffered beatings and torture. During clashes between police and protesters on Aug. 11, 54 people were arrested, among whom 30 were taken to hospital for treatment of police inflicted injuries. In a recent TV interview, a nurse from a hospital in North District of Hong Kong told Now News that the youngest protester treated at her hospital was only 16, that some protesters had been pummeled, and that several had severe bone fractures. The nurse covered her face with a black mask and sat in a public area with her back to the camera, when talking to the Now News interviewer. &nbsp; “The most serious case I saw was quite shocking,” she revealed. “An x-ray showed that the patient’s hand was being held together by just the skin because every bone had been fractured. Imagine how much force the police used to inflict such an injury!” Describing one protester who had fractures to the upper body, the nurse said: “This patient suffered excruciating pain. We were very worried that the fractured bones had pierced his lungs.” Another protester had bruises all over his body, making the doctors wonder how often the police had pounded him. According to the nurse, each hospitalized protester is monitored by at least four police officers, who watch the whole treatment process. The nurse expressed her indignation at such an intrusion into patient privacy. “In the ward where we treat the protesters, there are only a few beds, but more than 30 officers crowd in there. It was quite an intimidating scene,” she said. “Sometimes we need to expose the patient’s private parts to clean the wounds, but the police insist that they must be present.” Earlier this month, medical professionals staged a sit-in on three consecutive days on Aug. 12 to Aug. 14 to condemn the brutality of police. They urged police officers to stop using unnecessary and harmful crowd control weapons such as rubber bullets and sponge grenades. Police were also criticized for assaulting doctors and nurses while they provided medical assistance at the demonstration sites and obstructing them from attending to the injured protesters.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[The Phenomenon of Violence Among Chinese School Girls Exposed on Social Media]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F02%2F37%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese middle school girls in a choir performance. (Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images) Warning: Video contains images that could be disturbing to some viewers. News Analysis Seemingly every few weeks on Chinese social media, a new video comes out about a group of middle school students attacking and insulting one targeted girl. In the most recent video, a primary school girl, whose face is censored, is attacked by a group of boys, kicked and slapped inside a classroom, and then finally approached by a woman, who slaps her in front of everyone, according to an Aug. 26 report by Chinese online media Feng Videos. The girl was bullied at a school in Rucheng City of Hunan Province, China on Aug. 25, according to Feng Videos. The report stated that the incident is being investigated by police. Group Bullying The videos and events almost always turn out the same way, but the recent video is an exception. In most videos, one individual girl, generally middle school aged, sometimes younger, is cornered by a group of girls. She is verbally berated, then slapped and sometimes kicked for whatever wrong the larger group feels she committed. The girls will generally endure the punishment without expression and without fighting back. Also, at least one of the girls involved records the incident for an unreported reason. These videos generally then find their way onto social media, followed by online news organizations reporting about them. However, in this video, an adult also takes part in the abuse. The video shows a girl in a light blue shirt being slapped and kicked in the back by a group of students. Most of them appear to be boys, but at least one girl can be seen in the background. After the girl is thrashed for a moment, the children stop and walk away, giving way for a woman in a black dress. The girl turns and faces her, and after the person holding the camera backs up, the woman slaps the girl across the face once. The woman seems to say “Why are you afraid of me?” as she strikes the girl, as seen in the footage. Several other students appear to run out of the room as this happens. Bully Precedent The unfortunate abuse the girl suffered is not an isolated incident of group bullying in China. On May 11, a video made rounds on Chinese social media of a 15-year-old girl beating a 12-year-old girl in a hotel, according to Chinese news outlet Beijing Times. The older girl accused the younger of speaking badly of her. The video involves at least three girls cornering the 12-year-old, one recording and two violently interrogating her. The three girls, based on their physical height, all appear to be older than the 12-year-old. They slap her face, pull her hair, and fling her around the room. The girl recording the video even laughs as the younger girl is nearly thrown to the floor. In another instance, Chinese social media was quick to point out how many times two girls slapped one another in a 35 second video. The incident occurred on April 22, and one girl was slapped 14 times, according to Chinese news outlet Headline News. The report mentioned that the attack happened because the girl being slapped multiple times accidentally stepped on the other girl’s foot while on a trampoline. Younger girls are involved, too. On March 8, a group of primary school girls cornered one girl, holding her by the collar, according to The Beijing News. Another girl off camera slapped her and yelled at her, pointing a finger in her face. Over a month later, on April 27, public officials made the parents of the offending girl apologize to the victim and her family.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Chinese Regime Threatens More Action Against Hong Kong Protesters on Upcoming Full Moon]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F02%2F36%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Protesters standoff with police in a cloud of tear gas during a clash outside of Central Government Complex in Hong Kong on Aug. 31, 2019. (Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) One of the Chinese regime’s top agencies issued a veiled threat that a more severe crackdown against Hong Kong protesters could take place in two weeks. The Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, China’s head legal agency, in an opinion article published on its social media WeChat account on Sept. 1, accused the protesters of engaging in “terrorist acts” during the protests on Aug. 31. Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in the afternoon on Aug. 31, defying a police ban. That evening, skirmishes between protesters and police spread into the subway, where&nbsp; police charged into train cars in an attempt to arrest protesters. Footage showed images of people being beaten by riot police as they cowered on the floor behind umbrellas. The article warned that protesters couldn’t “get away” simply by “covering up their faces.” It suggested that they would meet their fate “on the day of the full moon.” It then warned protesters to take notice that the Asian holiday the Mid-Autumn Festival—which falls on the full moon on Sept. 13 this year—is just days away. The commentary continued that the presence of American flags in a march earlier in the day as “evidence of foreign interference.” The Chinese regime has repeatedly resorted to rhetoric accusing foreign governments, particularly the United States and the U.K., of “fomenting unrest” in Hong Kong. Beijing has also labeled the protesters as “radicals.” For more than three months, masses Hongkongers have filled the streets calling for the Hong Kong government to fully withdraw a now suspended extradition bill. Many fear that the bill would erode Hong Kong’s autonomy, as it would allow anyone in Hong Kong to be transferred to China for trial in courts controlled by the Chinese Communist Party—which is notorious for using its judicial system to silence critics and punish dissidents. Protesters have repeatedly urged the international community, particularly the British and the U.S. governments, to safeguard their human rights in the face of increasing instances of police violence against protesters—which have been condemned by rights organizations such as British non-profit Hong Kong Watch. Subway Violence The peaceful march on Aug. 31 descended into clashes between protesters and police in the evening. Protesters allegedly threw petrol bombs and bricks, while police fired round after round of tear gas and deployed water cannons. One of the clashes took place inside the Prince Edward Station, a metro station located in Mong Kok, a popular shopping district. Online videos showed that police officers pepper spraying and beating passengers. Some protesters could be seen shielding themselves with umbrellas, while one man was on his knees imploring the police to stop. Hong Kong police arrested over 40 people at the station, including a 13-year-old boy. Hong Kong Watch, in a Facebook post, condemned the police for what happened at the metro station, saying that “Hong Kong Police authorities owe an explanation to Hong Kong people and the international community.” U.S. congressman on Aug. 31 called for the immediate release of people detained on “politically motivated charges” and for Hong Kong authorities to stop the use of excessive force against protesters. Over Aug. 29 to Aug. 30, police arrested several prominent pro-democracy activists and lawmakers, on charges relating to unlawful assembly during previous protests. “Beijing’s refusal to give Hong Kong Authorities the latitude to respond to Hong Kongers’ concerns has exacerbated tensions. We call upon China’s leadership to reconsider this decision,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the leading Republican on the committee, in a joint statement. “Compromise will be necessary to defuse tensions and restore peace to this great city,” they added. Hong Kong police have arrested nearly 900 people in connection with the protests since June. Follow Frank on Twitter: @HwaiDer]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Chinese Media Spread Fake News that Western Man Arrested in Hong Kong is CIA Agent]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F09%2F02%2F35%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[An American-accent white man was arrested in Hong Kong on the evening of Aug. 31, 2019. (The Epoch Times) Footage of a man who appeared to be American being arrested on his way home inside a Hong Kong subway station on the evening of Aug. 31 has gone viral amid piling allegations of police brutality during another restive weekend in the city rocked by protests. In the aftermath, Chinese media has spread reports that the man is suspected of being a CIA “commander” in Hong Kong, in line with Chinese propaganda that the ongoing protests have been incited by “foreign forces.” “What charge is this? Otherwise it is unlawful!” the man, wearing a T-shirt and cargo shorts shouted, shouted in one video as he is escorted away by riot police at Lai King subway station. “This is Hong Kong, this is not China!” he said in an earlier video while surrounded by at least five riot police. In that scene, those police officers manage to wrestle him to the ground as he repeatedly shouts, “Do you agree with the rule of law?” Police then appear to use a zip-lock tie to restrain his hands behind his back. Footage of the incident and its lead-up captured by The Epoch Times appears to show that the man was arrested after he refused to use another exit from the platform as directed by police. During the incident, police told an Epoch Times reporter at the scene, “We are investigating,” without providing further details. The man who is not identified spoke with an American accent. In a video by The Epoch Times earlier in the night, the same man can be seen in a subway car speaking loudly to other passengers. In that video, he said he has been living in Hong Kong for 24 years and was on his way back home, which is close to Lai King subway station. “Why does Beijing want to hurt Hong Kong people,” the man said to other subway passengers. “Why does Beijing want to hurt you?” The man also criticized the Chinese regime for not fulfilling its pledge of allowing Hong Kong autonomy under the framework known as “one country, two systems” when it reverted from British rule in 1997. “Why do they [Beijing] want to take away what they promised? They promised a high degree of autonomy.” Chinese Media Allege Man is Suspected CIA agent Less than a day after the incident, reports have circulated on Chinese media that the man is suspected of being a CIA “commander” in Hong Kong. Popular Chinese news portal NetEase, as well as several other Chinese outlets, re-reported a news video by Chinese self-media Prism News, which alleged that the man was a CIA agent whose Chinese name is Bao Weizhong. #镜视频 据现场报道：美国中情局CIA香港指挥官，中文名叫包伟忠在香港机场被捕，其证件也被一同曝光。 pic.twitter.com/DVxp9rlRGr — 棱镜新闻PRISM News (@PressPRISM) September 1, 2019 The news video appears to attribute to the information to a social media post made by a Chinese netizen. The video also shows an image of a card which says “Press” and “Sveriges Radio” at the top, with a photo of the cardholder who is named as Martin Svenningsen. Sveriges Radio is Sweden’s public radio broadcaster. Svenningsen could not immediately be reached for comment. The Chinese regime has launched an extensive social media disinformation campaign against the protesters in Hong Kong, including running narratives that the protests are the work of “terrorists,” fomented by Western powers and “radical forces.” Recently, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube suspended hundreds of accounts linked to a Chinese regime-backed information operation seeking to undermine the protest movement in Hong Kong.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Citigroup, BNP Caught Up in US Case Against Huawei CFO: Documents]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F24%2F34%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Huawei's Financial Chief Meng Wanzhou leaves her family home flanked by private security in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on May 8, 2019. (Lindsey Wasson/Reuters) NEW YORK—U.S.-based Citigroup and French bank BNP Paribas are caught up in the U.S. criminal case against the chief financial officer of China’s Huawei Technologies, according to newly available documents. The banks were named in documents released on Aug. 20 after a hearing in British Columbia Supreme Court where Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou is fighting extradition to the United States on bank fraud charges. The two are among at least four financial institutions that had banking relationships with Huawei when Meng and others allegedly misled them about its business dealings in Iran despite U.S. sanctions. Two others, HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered, have been previously reported. The banks are considered “victim” institutions in the 13-count indictment the United States brought against Meng and Huawei, which includes charges of bank and wire fraud, violating sanctions against Iran and obstructing justice. Both she and Huawei have denied wrongdoing. Representatives for the four banks did not immediately respond to emails from Reuters seeking comment. But Standard Chartered, Citigroup and BNP Paribas have previously declined to comment when asked by Reuters about their possible involvement in the Huawei case. The court allowed the materials, including video of Meng’s arrest, to be made public in advance of a hearing scheduled to begin Sept. 23 in Vancouver. Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested at Vancouver’s airport in December on a U.S. warrant and her lawyers argue she was unlawfully detained. They claim Canadian authorities delayed her arrest to allow the border patrol to gather evidence for the United States as part of a “covert criminal investigation.” In the video, Meng can be seen moving through the Vancouver airport customs and immigration area, escorted by border agents, and being questioned. Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou is escorted by Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) staff during her arrival at Vancouver International airport in which she was arrested on a U.S. warrant, in a still image from video taken in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada on Dec. 1, 2018 and released on Aug. 21, 2019. (CBSA/Handout via Reuters) In a transcript, Meng repeatedly asks why she was being detained and is told she can contact a lawyer, but not her family. “My family members will be worried if they can’t find me,” she says. Meng was searched and interrogated for hours, her lawyers say. She spent more than a week in detention before being granted bail. Huawei’s Activities Tracked Before Trade War Diplomatic relations between Canada and China turned icy after Meng was detained and China subsequently arrested two Canadian citizens, charging them with espionage. It has also blocked imports of some Canadian commodities. Meng and Huawei also have become part of the escalating U.S. and China trade war. President Donald Trump told Reuters in December he would intervene in her case if it would help secure a deal with China. The U.S. government also has taken other actions against Huawei, claiming it is involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. The United States placed Huawei on a trade blacklist in May that bans the sale of U.S. parts and components to the company without special licenses, which it has not granted except to allow the repair and maintenance of existing products and networks. Huawei is the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker and a major smartphone provider. The United States also says its smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans. In one document released on Tuesday, the United States describes the evidence against Meng, including articles published by Reuters in 2012 and 2013 about a company in Iran called Skycom Tech that had tried to sell computer equipment by a U.S. company to a customer in Iran. The reporting detailed links between Huawei and Skycom, including that Meng had served on Skycom’s board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009. The articles were “concerning” to at least four financial institutions that banked for Huawei, according to the document, which was drafted by a U.S. federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, where the case was brought against Meng and Huawei. U.S. laws and regulations generally prohibited the banks from providing U.S. dollar transactions tied to Iran through the United States. Meng and others defrauded HSBC and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei’s relationship with Skycom, according to U.S. prosecutors who claim Skycom’s operations in Iran were controlled by Huawei from at least 2007 until 2014. U.S. authorities claim Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system. According to the newly available document about the evidence, witnesses for the prosecution of the U.S. case will include executives from HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citigroup, and an FBI forensic accountant is expected to testify about documents showing BNP Paribas provided banking services for Huawei between at least 2013 and 2018.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Policemen patrol inside the Hong Kong international airport on August 19, 2019. (GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images) HONG KONG—Two of the city’s police officers have been arrested after being caught on security camera torturing and beating a 62-year-old man. Only identified by his last name Chung, the elderly man was accused of assaulting a police officer while drunk and was sent to a psychiatric ward at a local hospital after an altercation on June 26. Captured on surveillance camera, the footage shows that while Chung was restrained on a hospital bed, two police officers punched Chung’s abdomen and genitals, slapped his face, covered his eyes and nose with his shirt to restrict his breathing, pushed his eyes with their fingers, and beat him with their batons. The assault went on for&nbsp;20 minutes. The footage was revealed by local lawmaker Lam Cheuk-Ting, of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, at a press conference on Aug. 20. The officers were arrested later that day. At another press conference convened on Wednesday, Lam said that in recent months, there has been a large number of complaints from anti-extradition-bill protesters regarding torture and assault by police officers. For months, Hongkongers have taken to the streets to oppose an extradition bill that would allow the Chinese regime to transfer individuals for trial in mainland China, where there is no rule of law. “It is an extremely horrific case in Hong Kong, and I’m afraid it is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Lam.&nbsp;“It is a very crucial case to prove the brutality of the police force.” He further called&nbsp;for a full investigation into the incident, adding that extradition bill protesters have recently broadened their demands to include an independent inquiry into police use of force during previous demonstrations—precisely because they believe the police force is abusing their power. Police have fired tear gas, rubber bullets, bean bag rounds, and other crowd control equipment at protesters in recent weeks. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as international and local rights groups, have condemned the Hong Kong police for using such equipment in ways that violate international norms, such as by shooting them at close range. “Hong Kong people will try our very best to fight for democracy peacefully, but in the face of Beijing’s dictatorship regime some of the youngsters have to sacrifice themselves so much,” said Lam. He urged citizens to come forward if they have been subjected to any form of police brutality.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F24%2F32%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[A U.S. flag on an embassy car is seen outside a hotel near a construction site in Shanghai, China on July 31, 2019. (Aly Song/Reuters) BEIJING—China unveiled on Aug. 23 retaliatory tariffs against about $75 billion worth of U.S. goods, putting an additional 10 percent on top of existing rates in the latest tit-for-tat exchange in a protracted dispute between the world’s top two economies. The latest salvo from China comes after the United States unveiled tariffs on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, including consumer electronics, scheduled to go into effect in two stages on Sept. 1 and Dec. 15. China’s commerce ministry said in a statement it would impose additional tariffs of 5 percent or 10 percent on a total of 5,078 products originating from the United States, including agricultural products such as soybeans, crude oil and small aircraft. China is also re-instituting tariffs on cars and auto parts originating from the United States. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told Fox Business News separately that trade negotiations with China would still go on behind closed doors. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office had no immediate comment on China’s tariffs announcement. The announcement comes as leaders of the Group of 7 major economies prepare to meet in France this weekend. The United States, Europe, Japan and other trading partners say Beijing’s development plans violate its market-opening commitments and are based on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology. The talks are deadlocked over how to enforce any deal. China insists President Donald Trump’s punitive tariffs have to be lifted as soon as an agreement takes effect. Washington says at least some have to stay to ensure Beijing carries out any promises it makes. Trump announced plans to raise tariffs Sept. 1 on $300 billion of Chinese products after talks broke down in May. Increases on some goods were postponed to Dec. 15. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed in June to resume negotiations. But talks in Shanghai in July ended with no indication of progress. Negotiators talked by phone this month and are due to meet again in Washington next month. The Associated Press contributed to this report.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[In Latest Veiled Threat, Chinese Military Says Troops Can Arrive In Hong Kong Within 10 Minutes]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F18%2F31%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese paramilitary police officers who serve on the border between Hong Kong and Guangdong province prepare to take part in anti-riot training exercises in Shenzhen of southern China's Guangdong province on June 5, 2017. (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images) Chinese military have posted a social media message containing a warning that Chinese troops are at the ready at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center, and can arrive in Hong Kong within 10 minutes. The warning was widely viewed as a threat toward Hong Kong protesters, who have staged large-scale demonstrations throughout the city since June, in opposition to an extradition bill that would allow mainland China to seek extradition of individuals to be trialed in its opaque legal system. The Eastern Theater Command, one of five regional divisions of the Chinese military, known officially as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), posted the following message on its official WeChat account, “People’s Frontline,” on Aug. 14: “The Shenzhen Bay Sports Center is 56 kilometers (34.8 miles) away from the Hong Kong airport. Troops only need 10 minutes to arrive at the Hong Kong [border].” Protesters have recently staged a multi-day sit-in at the airport in an effort to inform international travelers about their demands for the Hong Kong government to fully withdraw the bill. Satellite images collected on Aug. 12 by Maxar, a space tech company, appear to confirm that 500 or more armored vehicles from China’s paramilitary force are sitting on and around the soccer stadium at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center. Loaded Message The WeChat post also included an explanation of “ seven points of common knowledge,” hinting at the Chinese authorities’ capability to send troops to Hong Kong in the event of a crisis. “According to item 18 of the Hong Kong Basic Law [the city’s constitution], if the Hong Kong government cannot control turmoil that threatens national unity or national security, the [rubber-stamp legislature] National People’s Congress has the right to declare that Hong Kong is in a state of emergency. Then, Beijing can issue an order to implement relevant national laws in Hong Kong,” it warned. After Hong Kong reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, the city was guaranteed a high degree of autonomy with separate administrative, legislative, and judicial systems from mainland China. But the Hong Kong government can request Chinese authorities to step in to maintain “public order,” according to the Basic Law. The WeChat post went on to explain that China’s Counter-Terrorism Law grants Chinese authorities the right to to punish any form of terrorism, while the People’s Armed Police Force Law grants the paramilitary the power to police turmoil within Chinese territory. Beijing officials and Chinese state-run media have recently called the Hong Kong protests “budding terrorism,” while state media have recently published footage of the paramilitary’s armored vehicles going through the city of Shenzhen to gather for large-scale exercises. The post also cited a quote from former Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who once said that the PLA’s Hong Kong Garrison has a mission of “countering turmoil in Hong Kong.” Chinese paramilitary police officers take part in anti-riot training exercises in Shenzhen city of southern China’s Guangdong province on June 5, 2017. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) The PLA ended with an ominous message: it noted that according to the lunar calendar, Aug. 8 was the beginning of autumn. Locusts die in autumn due to the seasonal changes and a lack of food sources, it explained. Accompanying the long post was a photo of a locust, marked with the Chinese characters “poisonous Hongkongers,” to insinuate that Hong Kong protesters would disappear like locusts soon. Of note, the Eastern Theater Command that posted the social media message is in charge of central-eastern China. The PLA in Shenzhen and Hong Kong belongs to the Southern Theater Command. The eastern PLA also deleted the post after several hours. But many pro-Beijing social media accounts have reposted it before it was deleted. US Response U.S. President Donald Trump in a Twitter message on Aug. 13, also appeared to confirm China’s mobilization: “Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!” The U.S. State Department soon reacted with alarm. A spokesperson replied to The Epoch Times via email on Aug. 14: “The United States is deeply concerned by reports of Chinese paramilitary movement along the Hong Kong border…We condemn violence and urge all sides to exercise restraint.” The United States also said it would “remain staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong.” U.S. lawmakers across the aisle also recently rebuked Beijing for its veiled threats at a Hong Kong crackdown. At an Aug. 13 press conference, Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for China’s Foreign Ministry, angrily denounced the lawmakers’ comments. “They even incited the Hong Kong residents to engage in confrontation with the [Hong Kong] government and the central government,” Hua said. “How anxious are they to instigate and see chaos.” Beijing has consistently pushed the narrative that foreign governments are behind the protests challenging Beijing’s authority. Hua was referring to a Twitter post by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Aug. 12: “The people of Hong Kong are trying to preserve the promise of One Country – Two Systems. If we don’t speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere,” referring to the framework under which Beijing promised that the city would preserve its autonomy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also voiced his support for Hongkongers on Twitter: “The people of Hong Kong are bravely standing up to the Chinese Communist Party as Beijing tries to encroach on their autonomy and freedom. Any violent crackdown would be completely unacceptable. As I have said on the Senate floor: The world is watching.” On Aug. 14, the satellite office of China’s Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong published a commentary repeating Hua’s words, while claiming that the congress members’ tweets were evidence that the United States interferes in Hong Kong affairs. The U.S. State Department has consistently rebuked China for claims of foreign interference in the protests, saying that the “ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong reflect the sentiment of Hongkongers and their broad and legitimate concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy.” U.S.-based China affairs commentator Tang Hao said in an Aug. 14 YouTube video that the troop movement to Shenzhen is an upgraded threat, increasing the possibility that it would indeed send troops to quell the protests. Tang also analyzed that Trump’s recent tweet was meant to deliver a message to Beijing: the U.S. government is monitoring the situation in Hong Kong and the Chinese regime should not do whatever it pleases, he said.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Over 700 People Arrested By Hong Kong Police Since Protests Started]]></title>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Police fire tear gas to clear pro-Democracy protesters during a demonstration on Hungry Ghost Festival day in the Sham Shui Po district in Hong Kong on Aug. 14, 2019. (Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) Over 700 people have been arrested in connection with the ongoing protests in Hong Kong, and many of them are underage. A 14-year-old female student, surnamed Chan, told local media that she was not even a protester but was arrested for merely passing near a police station at Tin Shui Wai on Aug. 5, according to NOW. Earlier that day, protesters held a general strike and seven smaller-sized rallies across the city, demanding that the local government fully withdraw a now-suspended extradition bill.

Kwok/Getty Images) Chan said that she was on her way back to her school to buy textbooks when she was arrested along with one of her classmates. She said that police had suspected they were headed to take part in an unlawful assembly. After the rallies, protesters had occupied multiple districts in acts of civil disobedience against a local government that continued to avoid dialogue over the protesters’ demands. Chan was then held at the police station for more than 10 hours, during which she and her classmates were forbidden from calling their family. While being held, police demanded their passwords in order to unlock their cell phones. Chan explained that neither she nor her classmate knew that they could reject the police’s request at the time, and that they had handed over their passwords. After their release, police kept one of the phones for investigation, Chan told NOW. Lawrence Lau, a Hong Kong lawyer, told NOW that those under arrest have the right to not unlock their phones for police, unless the information is suspected to risk causing immediate harm. As for contacting their families and lawyers, Lau explained that the police have no right to forbid people from making those calls, given that they don’t interfere with the police investigation. Hong Kong police announced during a daily briefing on Aug. 15 that 748 people have been arrested in connection with the protests since June 9. Of these, 115 have been charged, police said. June 9 was the first of many mass protests against the extradition bill in Hong Kong. Over 1 million people took to the streets, fearing that the city’s judicial autonomy would be undermined by a law that would allow anyone passing through Hong Kong to be extradited and trialed in China’s courts. Communist China is infamous for using its judicial system to silence critics and dissents, giving them long sentences. Five individuals—four men and one woman aged between 20 and 22—were among the most recent arrests. They are suspected of removing a Chinese national flag from outside Harbour City shopping centre on Aug. 3 and throwing it into the city’s iconic Victoria Harbour, according to media reports. Riot police fire tear gas in the Mong Kok district of Hong Kong on Aug. 3, 2019. (Isaac Lawrence/AFP/Getty Images) Under Hong Kong’s Basic Law, its mini-constitution, a person found guilty of publicly desecrating the national flag by methods such as burning and damaging it could be sentenced to up to 3 years in prison. About 120,000 protesters had marched through Mong Kok on Aug. 3 before many dispersed into different parts of Kowloon, with some setting up roadblocks. After an evening of intense clashes with protesters, police announced that it had arrested at least 20 people for offenses such as unlawful assembly, possession of offensive weapons, and assault.

    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F18%2F29%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Ge Xiulan stands outside Binhai Prison holding flowers for her incarcerated husband on his birthday in 2018. Prison authorities didn’t allow her to visit him that day. (Minghui.org) Ge Xiulan has endured a lot in her efforts to get her husband released from prison, including being harassed and detained herself, but she’s not about to give up. Ge’s husband, Huang Liqiao, is serving a seven-year sentence for practicing Falun Gong, a spiritual discipline that has been brutally suppressed and persecuted by the Chinese communist regime since 1999. On Huang’s birthday last year, Ge showed up at Binhai Prison in Tianjin, bouquet of flowers in hand, to visit him. After waiting outside all morning, a guard finally came out and took the flowers, but she wasn’t allowed to see him. Ge wasn’t surprised. After Huang, an engineer, was sentenced in September 2012, it was five years before she was allowed to visit him, and even after that, visits have been very sporadic. Ge has been working to seek her husband’s release since day one, appealing to various government entities in an effort to have him freed, maintaining all along that he had done nothing wrong in exercising his constitutional right to freedom of belief and therefore his seven-year sentence was unlawful. “In movies, knives, guns, sticks, clubs, and drugs are often depicted as prosecution evidence. But there is no such evidence to prove Huang Liqiao had committed a crime. He was sent to prison to suffer endless torture,” Ge wrote in a letter to officials at the Tianjin Superior Court in July 2017 that was published on Minghui.org, which serves as a clearinghouse for information on the persecution campaign against Falun Gong. “Huang Liqiao has been wronged. In order to judge a person’s guilt, one must examine whether what he did has harmed other people. Aren’t people’s actions the best evidence?” The authorities threatened Gu, also a Falun Gong adherent, and interfered with her attempts to appeal for her husband. Her home was ransacked in 2013, and in March 2015, both her home and business were ransacked and she was detained in a labor camp for 25 days. Ge Xiulan and a lawyer after submitting her motion to the Tianjin Superior Court on July 31, 2017. (Minghui.org) Torture Beyond Endurance Starting in 2000, because he practiced Falun Gong and raised awareness about the facts behind the persecution campaign, Huang was held in a forced labor camp in Tianjin three times for a total of seven years, according to Minghui. Because he refused to be “transformed,” despite being forced to watch videos slandering Falun Gong, he became a prime target of the guards. During those years he was heavily tortured, sometimes to the brink of death. This included being shocked with electric batons, viciously beaten with a wooden club, having his limbs forcefully stretched in a bed, “hung up” by handcuffs, and deprived of sleep for long periods. Torture re-enactment: Shocking with electric batons. (Minghui.org) He was tied to his bed on a daily basis for as long as a year, except during mealtimes and toilet trips. In the summer he was covered with a heavy quilt to add to his suffering, while in winter, cold water was poured over him and the windows were left open. He was also forced to perform hard labor for long hours. If he fell asleep while working, the guards used electric batons to shock his head to wake him up. If he was unable to get up in the mornings, the guards instigated other inmates to stab him with needles. A type of torture called “one step to heaven” left him paralyzed, and he was bedridden for over two months and subsequently developed kidney problems. Ge Xiulan and a lawyer outside Tianjin First Intermediate Court on March 21, 2017, after submitting an appeal to contest her husband’s unjust prison sentence. (Minghui.org) ‘Nurturing Kindness in Our Hearts’ Each time Huang was released from the labor camp, he soon recovered his health through the care of his family as well as practicing Falun Gong, a traditional practice that teaches people to improve their character by following truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance. After he was again arrested in April 2012, he went on a hunger strike in protest and was force-fed—yet another type of torture. When it came time for his trial on July 24, 2012, he was so weak from having been on a hunger strike for more than 70 days that he had to be brought into the courtroom in a wheelchair. He was then diagnosed with tuberculosis, and on Sept. 20 he was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Instead of giving him a medical reprieve, however, the local court handed down the seven-year prison sentence six days later. Ge continues to appeal for Huang’s release and to be able to visit him more often. A motion she filed with the Tianjin Superior Court in July 2017 urging them to reconsider her husband’s case was rejected the following November. But she is not deterred, and she explains why at the end of her letter. “What matters more than life itself is people’s true nature. Only by nurturing kindness in our hearts can we become people of benevolence, loyalty, propriety, and truth. If we practice truthfulness and compassion, we can have tolerance when encountering problems,” she wrote. “If [the imprisonment of my husband] hadn’t violated my moral compass, I wouldn’t have had the courage to face the threat of life and death and to persevere all these years.”]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Hong Kongers Stage More Anti-Government Protests, Braving Storms]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F18%2F28%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Teachers protest against the extradition bill during a rally organized by Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union in Hong Kong, on Aug. 17, 2019. (Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters) HONG KONG—Thousands of Hong Kongers including many teachers took part in more anti-government rallies on Aug. 17, braving thunderstorms to march past shops shuttered due to growing concern that police could adopt tougher tactics to drive activists from the streets. Following an escalation in violence over the past few days, the rallies this weekend are a key test of whether the protest movement can retain the broad support that it has appeared to enjoy. The peaceful turnout suggested it may, though the protests turned more confrontational by nightfall. The protests began as opposition to a now-suspended extradition bill but have since grown to include broader demands. Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of the “one country, two systems” arrangement that enshrined some autonomy for Hong Kong since China took it back from Britain in 1997. “The government has been ignoring us for months. We have to keep demonstrating,” said CS Chan, a math teacher at a rally of teachers which police said was attended by up to 8,300 people. Yu, aged in her 40s and a music teacher at a local secondary school, said she was determined to show support for protesting students, even though she didn’t agree with all their actions. “I do appreciate their courage and caring about Hong Kong…they are definitely braver than our government,” she said. The tenor of clashes has intensified this week. Thousands of flights were canceled amid ugly scenes at the city’s airport, when protesters set upon men they suspected were Chinese agents. Police have shown fiercer determination to clear the streets. After gathering peacefully in the Central business district, the teachers marched on the Government House residence of Hong Kong’s embattled leader Carrie Lam, chanting “Hong Kong police know the law, they break the law.” “If Carrie bothered to respond to our demands at the very beginning, nobody would get hurt,” said Lee, a retired primary school teacher. Anti-government demonstrators also marched through Kowloon—the main built up area on the mainland side of Hong Kong harbor, while pro-police demonstrators turned out briefly on the other side of the bay, waving Chinese flags. Organizers of a pro-police counter-rally said 300,000 people turned out, while police put the number at 108,000. Reuters could not independently verify the figures. Kowloon shops drew their shutters in anticipation of violence. But some residents also came to the streets and set up card tables to distribute snacks, water, and herbal tea to demonstrators. “Of course, we worry about safety as violence is escalating each time. But there is not much we can do, except maybe bring a better helmet,” said Shadow Sze, 27, a volunteer medic. “We just to offer our help to those who feel helpless in the front line when they eat pepper spray and tear gas.” The demonstrations edged toward confrontation late in the afternoon, with protesters hurling eggs at a pro-Beijing trade union office and then surrounding Mong Kok police station. Hit and Run The increasingly violent confrontations have plunged one of Asia’s financial capitals into its worst crisis for decades. Western governments, including the United States, have stepped up calls for restraint, as Chinese paramilitary police have run drills close to the Hong Kong border. On Aug. 16, Cathay Pacific Airways replaced its chief executive after pressure from Beijing to suspend staff involved in the protests. The move was announced by Chinese state television before it was announced by the company. “We all feel tensions are building and the level of stress is increasing,” one front-line protester, Pun, 22, told Reuters during a sit-in at the international airport earlier in the week. “I know violence cannot fight violence but sometimes aggression is needed to attract the attention of the government and others,” he said. “I have thrown rocks… I have also been hit by police with batons. We’re all slowly getting used to this.” Chinese officials have likened some actions by protesters to “terrorism” and Chinese state media outlets have urged tougher response from Hong Kong police. Protesters have used slingshots to fire marbles at police, shone lasers at them and at times thrown bricks and firebombs. Having fired tear gas to disperse protesters in the streets, and at one point in a subway station, police are warning that they could get tougher. Although their stations have been targeted scores of times during the crisis, police have so far refrained from deploying armored cars which could smash through barricades. Nor have they used water cannon—two were purchased in 2014—or unleashed the force’s dog squad on protesters. Police have made some 750 arrests since the unrest began in June, and have charged some protesters with rioting which can attract a 10-year jail term as punishment.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Huang Qi, a human rights activist from Sichuan Province, China. Renowned Chinese dissident Huang Qi was sentenced to 12 years on July 29 for allegedly leaking state secrets to foreigners. Recently, Huang’s mother, who is under house arrest, hired a lawyer to take on his case. But the lawyer was suddenly taken away by police on Aug. 5, according to a source who spoke with The Epoch Times on the condition of anonymity. Huang Qi, 56, is the founder of 64 Tianwang, a news website blocked in mainland China that reports on human rights abuses and protests in the country, focusing on dissidents and petitioners, Falun Gong practitioners and other suppressed religious groups. Huang had served previous prison terms related to his website, and prior to the court verdict in July, he had been detained for two years. It is one of the harshest sentences that a dissident has received since Chinese leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. A source familiar with the case told the Chinese-language edition of The Epoch Times that Huang’s mother, Pu Wenqing, hired a lawyer from Beijing to represent him. The source wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter. Pu and the attorney, Zhang Lei, was scheduled to meet on Aug. 5 at her home. The source said that when Zhang arrived at Pu’s residential community, a group of men suddenly showed up and began pushing and dragging him around. Then Pu, who was expecting Zhang that day, came out of her home to see what was happening. As Pu is under house arrest, a guard who monitors her also came along. The source said that Pu ran over to Zhang and told him, “They (the authorities) have agreed that I can hire an attorney. They are breaking their promise!” Then policemen from the nearby Yongquan Police Station arrived at the scene and took Zhang away soon after one of the thugs notified them, according to the source. Several tall and muscular men then forcibly dragged Pu back to her residence. Zhang seemed to have anticipated danger. Before he left Beijing, he told his friends that if they did not hear from him by 9 p.m. on that day, then he must have run into trouble, the source said. 86-year-old Pu was under house arrest since Dec. 7, 2018 for appealing her son’s case. Because of the tremendous psychological stress, she’s lost her appetite and has difficulty sleeping. She has lost about ten pounds, becoming increasingly skinny. According to the information source, since Huang Qi was sentenced on July 29, Pu has sent numerous appeal letters to the higher courts in Chongqing and in the central judicial system, but got no response. She did not give up and continued to send appeal letters and to demand the right to hire an attorney for Huang. At first, the authorities forced Pu to accept the officially designated attorney for Huang’s case. But recently, the authorities allowed her to choose an attorney as long as the attorney provided a valid license (to practice law) and residential ID. Pu’s heart disease worsened as a result of constant intimidation and harassment from the authorities. In a recent medical examination, doctors suspected that she may have contracted lung cancer. She is therefore very eager to reunite with her son as soon as possible, the source revealed. Huang had previously suffered beating and torture at the detention center, causing his kidney disease to further deteriorate into the pre-uremic stage. Several attorneys who tried to defend Huang’s case, including Sui Muqing, Liu Zhengqing and Zhang Zanning, all have had their attorney license revoked by the Chinese authorities.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Pro-democracy protesters throw back tear gas fired by the police during a demonstratrion against the controversial extradition bill in Sham Shui Po district in Hong Kong on Aug. 11, 2019. (Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images) Hong Kong was rocked by mass demonstrations and clashes between protesters and police on Aug. 11, as protesters shifted tactics to flash mob-style encounters with police in the 10th straight weekend of unrest. Demonstrators recently adopted a strategy of retreating when pressed by police, only to reemerge en masse at another location. Police, in response, fired tear gas and charged with batons at protesters in several locations, from shopping boulevards to bar-lined streets, and also fired tear gas inside a train station. They have&nbsp; accused protesters of throwing gasoline bombs. The protests, which began more than two months ago in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to the mainland, has thrown the city into its most serious crisis in decades as its residents bristle against Beijing’s growing encroachment. Thousands of protesters participated in a peaceful rally at Victoria Park in the afternoon, while other demonstrators gathered in the streets of different communities to seek a full withdrawal of the bill. Mickey, 16, said many of her classmates chose to sacrifice their study time for the “dream” of Hong Kong’s future despite not knowing if it would lead anywhere. “We saw that many people who had the courage to stand up are losing their rights,” she told the Hong Kong bureau of The Epoch Times at the rally in Victoria Park. “The government called us middle schoolers ‘rioters,’ but we are simply going to the streets to exercise our rights, and the police just disperse people with weapons. “History will prove what we did to be right.” At Hong Kong International Airport, protesters continued a peaceful sit-in at the arrivals hall for a third and final day.

(ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images) In the evening, police fired tear gas in the tourist area Tsim Sha Tsui in Kowloon district, and the district of Wanchai, known for its bars and night-life. Police later said an officer at Tsim Sha Tsui suffered burns in the leg from a gasoline bomb. According to hospital authorities, 13 people were injured and taken to hospital on Aug. 11, with two people in serious condition, local media reported. One female protester at Tsim Sha Tsui, local media reported, was shot in the right eye with a bean bag round, which penetrated through her goggles. Riot police also deployed tear gas and rubber bullets inside Kwai Fong metro station. Video footage shows officers firing rubber bullets at close range and beating protesters with batons. Hong Kong local non-profit Civil Rights Observer condemned the police’s use of tear gas bombs inside the railway station. “We believe that the practice was not only an improper and excessive use of force, but also threatened the personal safety of demonstrators and other citizens,” Civil Rights Observer said in a Facebook post. “According to the safety guidelines of the supplier, tear gas can only be used outdoors or in a well-ventilated area.” British Call Earlier in the week, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to relay concerns over the ongoing protests in the former British colony. Raab condemned “violent acts by all sides but emphasised the right to peaceful protest,” and “underlined that the violence should not cloud the lawful actions of the majority,” the UK foreign office said in a statement. He suggested Lam engage in “meaningful political dialogue,” and launch “a fully independent investigation into recent events as a way to build trust.” Raab’s call drew the ire of the Chinese regime. “The United Kingdom has no sovereignty, jurisdiction, or right of supervision over Hong Kong.” Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said at a regular briefing on Aug. 10. “It’s a mistake that the British government called Hong Kong Chief Executive directly to exert pressure,” she said. Meanwhile, the city’s flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways on Aug. 10 said it suspended one pilot for “rioting,” and dismissed two ground staff for leaking travel information for a Hong Kong police soccer team who were due to fly to China. China’s aviation authority had earlier demanded the airline suspend staff members involved in the protests.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese dissident Huang Qi poses in his apartment in Chengdu, Sichuan Province on Jan. 22, 2015. (Fred Dufour/AFP/Getty Images) WASHINGTON—The United States on Aug. 1 called for China to immediately release an imprisoned veteran human rights activist, saying a Chinese court violated fundamental human freedoms this week when it sentenced him to jail for 12 years. Huang Qi, who has been detained since 2016 and is known for running a website tracking abuse accusations, was also stripped of his political rights for four years in the sentence handed down on Monday by a court in China’s southwestern province of Sichuan. “We call on China to immediately release Mr. Huang, and to allow him access to his family, medical care, and legal counsel as soon as possible,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. “The imprisonment of Huang Qi underscores China’s continued repression of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including free speech,” she added. “We urge the Chinese government to uphold its international commitments related to fair trial guarantees and the rule of law.” Huang’s sentence&nbsp;is one of the most severe rulings against a dissident since Chinese leader Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. Huang, an engineering graduate from Sichuan University, founded 64 Tianwang in the late 1990s, along with an organization called Tianwang Tracing Office, aimed to track cases of human trafficking by posting information about missing persons. Through his website, 64 Tianwang, Huang reported on human rights concerns relating to groups targeted by the regime, including dissidents, petitioners, Falun Gong practitioners, and other suppressed faith groups in the country. His website is censored in China. By Susan Heavey. Epoch Times reporter Nicole Hao contributed to this report.]]></content>

(Billy H.C. Kwok/Getty Images) Chater Garden in the heart of Hong Kong’s bustling financial district of Central was again packed with protesters on Aug. 2 evening. According to organizers, an estimated 40,000 civil servants showed up in rare defiance against the Hong Kong government.

Kwok/Getty Images) The rally reiterated the five demands that protesters have repeated in the past few months as they opposed a controversial extradition bill: drop all charges against arrested protesters; withdraw the bill; establish an independent commission to investigate police use of force; call for current Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam to resign; and institute universal suffrage. The bill, which has been indefinitely suspended amid public outrage, would have allowed the Chinese regime to seek extradition of criminal suspects. It has drawn widespread opposition as Hongkongers fear that dissidents could be punished at will, and the city’s rule of law eroded.

(Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images) Meanwhile in nearby Edinburgh Place, medical workers also staged a mass rally demanding the release of a nurse who was arrested on July 28 as she was tending to injured protesters. Organizers said that around 10,000 attended the demonstration. The Friday events follow a flash mob hosted by the city’s banking professionals on Thursday, in solidarity with protesters’ demands.

(Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images) Citizens First Themed “Civil Servants Stand Together With the Public,” the civil servant rally took off at 7 p.m. local time, despite a stern government warning issued the previous day reminding the city’s roughly 180,000 civil servants to be loyal to the administration. “The Hong Kong government will absolutely not accept any conduct that challenges the principle of civil servants’ political neutrality,” the statement read. “Regardless of their political ideology, civil servants must show unreserved loyalty to the current chief executive and the government.” It also warned of serious consequences should civil servants violate rules regarding political neutrality. Members of the territory’s medical sector attend a protest in Edinburgh Place in Hong Kong on Aug. 2, 2019. (Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images) Many at the rally said that they felt compelled to come out despite the pressure. A customs official surnamed Zhang told the Hong Kong bureau of The Epoch Times that although he would be impartial in fulfilling his duties as a civil servant, he was “first a Hongkonger and therefore also needs to be loyal to the Hong Kong citizens.” Zhang added that recent events, such as the police denying applications to hold marches and firing rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters, showed that even Hongkongers’ right to peaceful assembly were being stripped away. Thus, he felt the need to give support to the protesters.

Kwok/Getty Images) Several other retired officials echoed the sentiment during rally speeches. Joseph Wong, former Secretary for the Civil Service, said that civil servants are duty-bound to point out anything in the leadership’s conduct that deviates from the rule of law. He as well as former Legislative Council member Margaret Ng both agreed that that the rule of law is superior to any government official. “Having been a lawmaker for 18 years, I want to share a thought from the bottom of my heart,” Ng said. “The biggest asset that Hong Kong has for the democratic system and democratic elections is that we have a group of professional, outstanding civil servants who understand and protect the fair system, and who can bring their professional input to the administrative branches dutifully and with impartiality.” She added: “Cheers to them at this tough moment in time.” People attend a protest held by civil servants in the Central District of Hong Kong on Aug. 2, 2019. (Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images) Marches and protests have been planned for the weekend, in Hong Kong’s Mong Kok, Tseung Kwan O and Sai Ying Pun districts. For Aug. 5, protesters are calling for a general strike. Organizers are planning several rallies in various neighborhoods around the city, though police have yet to grant approval for any of the locations, according to Hong Kong public broadcaster RTHK. Initially suggested on the popular online forum Lihkg.com, the strike has since acquired endorsements from pro-democracy lawmakers, trade unions, the city’s teachers’ association, 34 banks, airlines, as well as several associations in the local entertainment industry. A dozen of RTHK presenters will also join the strike, along with at least 2,000 social workers. Follow Eva on Twitter: @EvaSailEast]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Survivors of China’s Internment Camps Reveal that Detainees Include Han Nationals and Falun Gong Practitioners]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F08%2F02%2F23%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Local police patrol at a village in Hotan prefecture in China's western Xinjiang region on February 17, 2018. (Ben Dooley/AFP/Getty Images) China’s far west Xinjiang region is home to many Muslim minorities, including Uyghurs and Kazakhs. Human rights groups estimate that around one million Muslims have been arbitrarily detained in the region’s internment facilities, which is referred to as “re-education camps” in China. Only a few detainees have managed to leave China after they were released, providing a rare opportunity for the outside world to know what goes on inside these camps. Chinese authorities justify “re-education” as a measure to prevent religious “extremism” and “terrorist activities,” and to ensure “ethnic unity” and national security. Moreover, these camps were recently renamed to “vocational education centers,” as China is facing continuous criticism from the international community. According to a July 31 report from Radio Free Asia, two survivors from different detention centers say they have seen Han nationals and Falun Gong practitioners in their camps. Gulzira Auelkhan, a Chinese citizen and ethnic Kazakh who has residency rights in Kazakhstan, returned to Xinjiang to visit her parents on July 16, 2017. She was detained by the Chinese border officials, and three days later, sent to a “re-education camp” where she was held for 19 months. She was then sent to a factory to perform labor until she was released last October. She was told that the reason for the detention and re-education was that she could not speak Mandarin. A Kazakh human rights organization pressured Chinese authorities to release Gulzira. She was allowed to leave China and reunite with her husband in Kazakhstan at the beginning of this year. However, her two daughters are still left behind in Xinjiang. Gulzira told Radio Free Asia that she had to wear a camp uniform and was forced to study Mandarin every day during her detention at the “re-education camp.” She said that all inmates had to study Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s speeches, the “glory” of China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative, and the so-called ethnic unity. Half a month after she was sent to the camp, she was forced to receive an unknown injection. Her long hair was cut short, and the authorities explained that the detention center is run like a military camp. Gulzira revealed that she had personally seen Falun Gong practitioners and Han nationals in her detention center, along with Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kirghizes, Hui, and Tatars. She came into contact with two Han nationals, one of them was young and the other was an elderly person. According to camp regulations, within each ethnic group, it was forbidden for three or more people to get together for a conversation. Another detainee, a Han national from Xinjiang’s Altay Prefecture who had been held at an internment camp, shared his personal experience with Radio Free Asia on the condition of anonymity. Last summer the police ransacked his home and found ethnic crafts that he’d been selling. They took him to the police station where he was interrogated and subjected to a torture method called “tiger bench” for three days and three nights in a row. He was not allowed to sleep until after 2 o’clock in the morning. As soon as he woke up, he would be bound onto the tiger bench again. The police asked how he obtained the ethnic crafts and why he travelled abroad. They also threatened to send his family to the “re-education camp.” After the interrogation, the police took him to the People’s Hospital of Altay City, where he was forced to have blood drawn, undergo abdominal and chest B-ultrasound examination, urine test and electrocardiogram in the name of a ”routine medical examination.” He suffered continuous torture for nearly a month. During this period of time, he passed out multiple times, and was at the brink of death. In the end, he was transferred from the police station to a “re-education camp” in Altay city. He was held at the camp for nearly one year, where he met with more than 30 Han nationals. He revealed that the Han detainees he met included petitioners, religious believers and rights activists. All had been forced to go through the medical examination and forced to pay for it. Taiwanese online media The Reporter exposed a similar story. Kazakh citizen Yar Khali was arrested when he entered Xinjiang on Nov. 9, 2017. The charges include traveling to Kazakhstan, practicing Islam and downloading WhatsApp on his mobile phone. Although he did not plead guilty, he was held in the “re-education camp” for more than 400 days, where he suffered different forms of torture—such as being slapped, punched, beaten with electric batons, and starved for several days. Yar Khali told The Reporter that his personal experience helped him understand that these camps have nothing to do with the so-called “fighting against extremism.” Instead, it is an instrument of dictatorship used to persecute ordinary civilians. He too had seen Falun Gong practitioners, Christians and Han Chinese among the camp detainees. “If the truth of the ‘re-education camp’ is made known to all, the various ethnic groups would unite to fight against the Chinese communist regime,” Yar Khali said, “because the Chinese regime is persecuting every citizen, every religion.”]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Violent Attack in Hong Kong Highlights Pro-Beijing Lawmaker’s Shady Past]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F25%2F22%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho speaks during a press conference in a meeting room of the Legislative Council in Hong Kong on July 22, 2019. (ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images) A violent attack inside a Hong Kong metro station has drawn public scrutiny over a local pro-Beijing lawmaker and his history of condoning violence. On the night of July 21, dozens of masked men in white shirts stormed a train station in Hong Kong’s northwestern town of Yuen Long, wielding wooden sticks and metal bars and beating at passengers indiscriminately. At least 45 were injured, with one in serious condition. Many were returning home from participating in an earlier protest against an extradition bill, which would allow any country, including mainland China, to seek extradition of criminal suspects. The since-suspended bill has drawn widespread opposition, as many Hongkongers fear that the proposal would erode the city’s rule of law and allow individuals to be sent to face trial in China’s opaque legal system. The city has erupted in controversy over the police’s delayed response to the Yuen Long attacks. According to witnesses, they did not arrive on the scene until about an hour later. Hong Kong police have admitted to their delay, and since arrested 11 in connection with the attacks. They also confirmed that some suspects have a “triad background.” Locals are also enraged at video footage that showed Junius Ho, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, shaking hands with and giving the thumbs up to men wearing white who appeared in the same area on the evening of July 21. In the video, Ho can be heard praising them for their “hard work.” Many have since accused Ho of colluding with local triads in Yuen Long to orchestrate the attack. Ho’s local office was vandalized on July 22, with glass panels smashed and graffiti spray-painted on the walls. The messages criticized him for being an ardent supporter of Beijing. A public petition initiated on the U.S. White House website demanding that Ho and his family members be denied entry to the United States or eligibility for U.S. citizenship has drawn over 178,000 signatures.

(Song Bilong/The Epoch Times) Protesters place placards and memos on the office of pro-Beijing government lawmaker Junius Ho in Hong Kong’s Tsuen Wan district on July 22, 2019. A large banner reads, “Ho colluded with local triads in staging terrorist attacks against civilians, while the police drew public anger by shielding them.” (Song Bilong/The Epoch Times) In a televised forum on July 23, Ho responded to the criticism, saying that he “never regretted” shaking hands with the men in white, and that the actions of the assailants “could be pardoned.” He also urged the city to put a stop to extradition bill protests. And in a July 25 interview with the Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times, Ho said that Beijing could send its military “to restore tranquility” should the situation in Hong Kong “reach an uncontrollable state”—reiterating comments by China’s defense minister on July 24 when he hinted that Chinese military could be sent to Hong Kong to quell protests. Dark History Ho has been embroiled in multiple controversies throughout the years. In 2017, he drew criticism for saying that pro-independence activists in Hong Kong should be “killed without mercy.” Known for his pro-Beijing stance, he is pejoratively nicknamed a “godson of Sai Wan,” the latter referring to the neighborhood where Beijing’s representative Liaison Office is located. The Office allegedly helped Ho get elected as a lawmaker in 2016. His opponent at the time, Ken Chow, said in a September 2016 press conference where he announced his withdrawal from the race, that he was verbally intimidated by “three people from Beijing.” They demanded that he quit the race in order to improve the chances of pro-Beijing candidates in the elections, he said. In August 2016, Chow also exposed to media an audio recording sent to him, where one of Ho’s campaign volunteers mentioned deploying people to “pressure” Chow. Ho also has a record of supporting violent groups. He is currently the honorary chairman and legal counsel to a communist front group in Hong Kong, called the “Hong Kong Youth Care Association.” Since the group’s formation in 2012, The Epoch Times has documented how the group has harassed, intimidated, and attacked local practitioners of Falun Gong, a spiritual discipline that is heavily suppressed on the mainland. In Hong Kong, where there is still a degree of autonomy and the guarantee of religious freedom, Falun Gong adherents are free to practice their faith.

Members of the association were seen attending a July 20 rally in support of the city’s police force. The rally had condemned extradition bill protesters, and Association members were seen distributing hate propaganda against Falun Gong.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[What’s Behind China’s Constitution Changes]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F20%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese leader Xi Jinping arrives for the fourth plenary session of the National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 13, 2018. (Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images) The news of China abolishing term limits for the state chairman position has led many to speculate that current chairman Xi Jinping may rule for life. Many media surmised that China would soon return to a Mao Zedong-like dictatorship. Others, including The Epoch Times, analyzed Xi’s move as indicative of his need to further consolidate his power within a party still fractious and embroiled in factional battles. Officials loyal to former Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin make up a major oppositional force to the Xi leadership—though at last October’s important political conclave, the 19th National Congress, the Jiang faction saw its power weakened after Xi was able to appoint many of his allies to top positions. In recent days, analysts and media around the world have offered alternative readings of why Xi set off this precedent-breaking maneuver. If he did not cement his power at all levels, it could also hit him after his second term in office: downfall, jail, and prison sentence. — From an analysis by Austrian newspaper Die Presse Xi had made too many enemies with his anti-corruption campaign that felled thousands of Party bigwigs, so “if he did not cement his power at all levels, it could also hit him after his second term in office: downfall, jail, and prison sentence,” according to Austrian newspaper Die Presse, in an analysis published on March 12.

(Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images) Some of those top officials include Zhou Yongkang, the former security czar and right-hand man to Jiang; Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, two powerful military generals; and Ling Jihua, chief political adviser to Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao. Meanwhile, Chenshen Yen, researcher at National Chengchi University’s Institute of International Relations in Taiwan, told Radio Free Asia that he believes Xi abolished term limits not necessarily to serve another term himself but to prevent oppositional forces from gathering power to name their own successor, “for example, if Hu Jintao made his choice for Xi’s successor.” “In the past, the Party leader skips a generation to appoint the following leader,” Yen said, referring to the practice since Deng of the incumbent being able to appoint the leader who follows his immediate successor. Last year, Xi purged Sun Zhengcai, who was widely believed to be Xi’s successor. Sun was closely aligned with the Jiang faction. Deng Yuwen, a researcher at the China-based think tank Charhar Institute, penned an editorial in the Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post explaining why he thinks it’s unlikely Xi will serve for life. “To repeal the term limits, Xi would have needed the consent of senior party members. If he is forcing the rule change without such a consensus, he may worsen divisions in the leadership, which would impede the working of his own government. Thus, Xi is likely to have promised the party elite that he would not wreck the institution of political succession by staying in power for life,” Deng wrote in an article published on March 14. Deng also pointed out that the regime is keen to maintain its image and would not want to risk the public’s negative reaction to a leader-for-life—especially given the fervent voices of opposition on Chinese social media (which were quickly censored) upon announcement of the Party’s plan to abolish term limits.

    <title><![CDATA[Security Spending Soars in China’s Troubled Xinjiang Region]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F19%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese soldiers participate in an anti-terror drill in Hami, Xinjiang region, China on July 8, 2017. (Reuters) BEIJING—Spending on security-related construction tripled in 2017 in China’s far western region of Xinjiang, where Beijing is accused of detaining as many as one million ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims, an academic analysis of government expenditure found. Beijing says its “vocational training centers” in Xinjiang camps teach employment skills and legal knowledge aimed at curbing religious extremism. The report published on Nov. 5 by U.S. think-tank the Jamestown Foundation examined government budget data and found spending on security-related construction in Xinjiang rose last year by nearly 20 billion yuan ($2.90 billion), or 213 percent. “Xinjiang’s budget figures do not reflect increased spending on vocational education…as the region ramped up camp construction; nor do they reflect an increase in criminal cases handled by courts and prosecutors,” said the report’s author, Adrian Zenz, an anthropologist at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany. “Rather, they reflect patterns of spending consistent with the construction and operation of highly secure political re-education camps designed to imprison hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs with minimal due process.” It also found that despite the purported large “vocational training” campaign, employment outcomes had not markedly improved, according to Xinjiang’s own official employment figures. Whatever training the facilities do provide, Zenz said, it appeared it was not administered or paid for by the vocational education system. The Xinjiang government and the State Council Information Office, which doubles as the Communist Party’s spokesman’s office, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. On Tuesday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she did not personally know how much Xinjiang’s security expenditure was. Reports of mass detentions and strict surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims have prompted the United States to consider sanctions against officials, such as Xinjiang Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo, and companies linked to accusations of human rights abuses. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers proposed legislation on Oct. 10 that would urge U.S. President Donald Trump to condemn “gross violations” of human rights in Xinjiang and to press his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to close the “political re-education camps” immediately. Other sanctions raised for consideration by the proposed act include a ban on sales or provision of U.S.-made goods or services to Xinjiang state agents and the barring of certain Chinese entities—including the Xinjiang police bureau—from purchasing U.S.-made equipment that could be used for surveillance. Over the years, Xinjiang has been transformed into a vast security state, packed with police stations, street cameras, and security checkpoints at which electronic identity cards are scanned. After initial blanket denials, Chinese officials said in recent weeks they were not enforcing arbitrary detention and political re-education across a network of secret camps, but rather that some citizens guilty of “minor offenses” were sent to vocational centers to provide employment opportunities. While prison expenditure doubled between 2016 and 2017, spending on prosecution on criminal suspects was largely flat, Zenz said, indicating it was likely that few of the so-called criminals involved only in minor offenses were put on formal trial. China’s record will be examined by the U.N. Human Rights Council on Tuesday, the first time since 2013, in a regular review expected to focus on its treatment of ethnic minorities, especially Uyghurs and Tibetans. By Philip Wen.

    <title><![CDATA[In Communist China, Reform Is a Dead End]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F18%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[A Chinese paramilitary policeman reacts outside the opening session of the Chinese Communist Party's five-yearly Congress at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Nov. 8, 2012. (MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images) Xiang Songzuo, deputy director and senior fellow at the Center for International Monetary Research at China’s Renmin University, delivered a speech on Dec. 16 that detailed a series of problems afflicting the Chinese economy. His prognosis is much more gloomy than what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is willing to admit. At the end of his speech, Xiang proposed three reforms: tax reform, political reform, and national reform. These were clearly meant as suggestions to authorities on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of China’s “reform and opening up.” But those who harbor hope that the Party will restart reforms 40 years after the first round are likely to be disappointed. Regardless of who heads the Party today, it’s impossible to return to the era of Deng Xiaoping, the CCP leader who initiated economic reforms in 1978. In fact, the seeds of the failure we see now were planted at the onset of Deng’s reforms. Those reforms began right after the end of the Cultural Revolution. Almost every aspect of economic development had to be started from scratch, and there was no clear policy on anything. The two most important and well-known policies were simply “easing restrictions” and “crossing the river by feeling the stones.” It’s now widely agreed that the reform movement is dead, with the only debate being as to when it died. Some say it was over in 1989, after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Another explanation puts it 20 years later, in 2008 or 2009. There are those who say that reform was “alive” until after 1989, when it was shifted to serve the power of the Party elite. However, the students gunned down at Tiananmen were already protesting against the forces of corruption and privilege in the reforms. Even in the earliest developments of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when one may have genuinely spoken of reform, we must still consider what it was that was being changed. The reform began in the countryside, in the small village of Xiaogang in Anhui Province. Eighteen villagers signed a life-or-death contract to split up their collective farm. The document guaranteed that if the village cadre was arrested, the entire village would help raise his children to adulthood. How courageous of them to stand up to the political pressure facing them! But who was pressuring them? It was the Communist Party. The rural reform was none other than to break the Party’s yoke. How is it that the Party took credit for this achievement? In the cities, reform followed the model of allowing some people to get rich first; that is, to allow the existence and development of the private economy and its development. In both the urban and rural experiences, the early reforms were nothing more than denying the “three major transformations” of the pre-reform period of communist rule, including the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. These “achievements” were the elimination of private ownership, while the reform and opening up was the partial recovery of private ownership. Why should both be considered the CCP’s achievements, when it would have simply been better to not undertake the socialist transformations in the first place? Later reforms included reform of state-owned enterprises as part of China’s entry to the WTO, which had the side effect of causing a large number of workers to lose their jobs, while shifting ownership of state assets to the elites for criminally low prices. Other “reforms” include those in education, health care, and housing. In communist propaganda, the term “three great mountains” refers to the oppressive imperialism, feudalism, and capitalist bureaucracy from which the CCP claimed to have liberated the Chinese people. Today, education, health care, and housing are widely mocked as the “new three great mountains.” Party officials from the central to local levels seem to have a special preference for “reform,” since it benefits the CCP elite. In this sense, all officials are “reformists” and there are no “conservatives.” The positive aspects of China’s economic reform are that it partially restored the “old society” that existed prior to the establishment of the communist regime, and that it brought in foreign technology and managerial methods. But there was never any political reform in the meaningful sense of the word, and, thus, never any reformists. Some people think that the abolition of lifelong leadership and the establishment of “collective leadership” constituted political reform, yet the Tiananmen Square Massacre happened anyway. And the brutal persecution of Falun Gong that has lasted 19 years was begun under the “collective leadership” of Jiang Zemin and his factional allies. Whatever the circumstance, the CCP has never corrected its cyclical pattern of periodic human-rights abuses. The history of the Communist Party’s rule is filled with such tragedies. The Lushan Conference of 1959 failed to correct the “leftist inclination” of the disastrous Great Leap Forward campaign, and instead, a further 20 million people starved to death after Mao Zedong’s ideological assault on the “rightists.” Under Deng’s Four Cardinal Principles that re-established the political supremacy of the CCP and Marxism, the liberalizing tendencies were doomed, and reformist leaders such as Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang were purged. The historical pattern shows that there’s something in the nature of the CCP that makes true reform impossible. Today, the CCP faces an ideological and theoretical dilemma in every aspect of its existence, from political economy to diplomacy. This is an inevitable result of the four decades of partial reform, which occurred only with great internal contradictions. No reform can be successfully implemented if its goal is to save the Party’s rule.

    <title><![CDATA[Woman Dies 3 Months After Prison Release: Years of Torture Damaged Her Body]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F17%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[A reenactment of a Falun Gong practitioner being tortured by police in a detention center. (Minghui.tv) Before she succumbed to her injuries, Liu Zhenfang filed a criminal complaint recounting her ordeal—a harrowing description of how the Chinese communist regime destroyed her body, but could not break her faith—over twenty long years. Liu, a 60-year-old resident of Huangchuan County, Henan Province passed away on Dec. 7, 2018, three months after her release from Henan Women’s Prison, according to Minghui.org, a U.S.-based website that serves as a clearinghouse on the persecution of Falun Gong in China. Her body was emaciated, and most of her internal organs had festered. In 2017 Liu had been sentenced to a 1.5-year prison term for practicing Falun Gong, a spiritual discipline which upholds the tenets of truth, compassion, and forbearance. Those who subscribe to this belief have been persecuted by the Chinese communist regime from 1999 to the present day. The Persecution Liu, a hairdresser, began practicing Falun Gong in 1998 after hearing about its health benefits at a time where China’s health reforms were outdated. Falun Gong, which translates to “law wheel practice,” is a spiritual discipline with a set of meditation exercises and texts that preach virtues, containing moral philosophies with Buddhist and Taoist elements, and draws on China’s long tradition of qigong, a regimen of controlled breathing and gentle physical movements. When then Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Jiang Zemin launched a systematic campaign to vilify and destroy Falun Gong in 1999, Liu refused to renounce her faith, and became a police target. Her house was ransacked three times between 1999 and 2003. In early 2000, Liu was detained in the Hedian Detention Center, where police extorted 2,000 yuan from her before she was released. Her second arrest in 2001 saw police bring her to a secret detention facility after finding Falun Gong materials in her home. Liu was forced to stand overnight without sleep, and the police took all the money she brought with her. Police interrogated Liu for the source of the materials, and she was beaten for more than 20 hours for her silence. Her head was slammed against a wall, and clumps of hair were pulled out, resulting in scalp injuries. She was hung from the window frame with handcuffs and beaten until she vomited blood. She was sent to the Hedian Detention Center again and held for three months, until her family paid the deputy director at the Domestic Security Division to secure her release. In 2004, Liu was arrested for distributing Falun Gong materials. Following her incarceration, she was beaten for 16 hours by police at the Guangshan Police Department. They pulled her hair and ripped her clothes. When the officers became tired of beating her barehanded, they used a metal rod and took turns hitting her until the rod was broken. They used the broken metal rod to beat her fingers. Then she was taken to the Guangshan Detention Center, where she was beaten for 33 hours. Her internal organs were damaged, and following these attacks, she often vomited blood. Liu survived the torture. The police also detained Liu’s husband in 2004 for five months, despite him not being a Falun Gong practitioner. He was forced to do slave labor and was given one meal per day. Guards tied his testis with a thin thread and burned it with a lighter. Liu was arrested again in 2012. She was sentenced to a five-year prison term, where her ordeal continued. Despite her injuries, she was forced to work for 14 hours every day. In 2017, Liu was handed another prison term for 1.5 years, and it would end up killing her. During Liu’s total time in incarceration, she was also verbally abused, fed nerve-damaging drugs, forced to do slave labor, stand for days without sleep, and squat for hours with her hands on her head. Before the persecution, Falun Gong had an estimated 70 million to 100 million adherents in China across every social class, including members of the communist party. Meditating practitioners were a common sight in parks and public squares in every city.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Whose Hearts, Livers and Lungs Are Transplanted in China?]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F11%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[It’s not always clear where human organs come from in research papers. (Piron Guillaume/unsplash) Scientist He Jiankui’s claimed use of the genetic tool CRISPR to edit the genomes of twin girls led to international condemnation. His actions have focused a spotlight on research ethics—and what the consequences should be when scientists “go rogue.” The Chinese Academy of Science initially looked into He’s conduct, and a subsequent internal government investigation has allegedly identified multiple violations of state laws. He has now been fired by his university. But beyond just this example, what does happen when scientists fail to comply with globally-accepted guidelines for ethical medical research? We examined this issue focusing on published research involving recipients of organ transplants performed in the People’s Republic of China. International professional standards ban publication of research that: involves any biological material from executed prisoners lacks human research ethics committee approval lacks consent of donors. But as described in our new paper, we found that research which does not comply with these standards is regularly accepted for publication in international peer-reviewed journals. Human organ transplants in China Using a scoping review methodology, we examined 445 studies published in peer-reviewed English language journals between January 2000 and April 2017. The papers reported research involving recipients of human organ transplants (limited to hearts, livers or lungs) taking place in China. The data included 85,477 transplants. We found that 92.5 percent of the publications failed to state whether or not the transplanted organs were obtained from executed prisoners. Nearly all of them (99 percent) failed to report whether organ donors gave consent. In contrast, 73 percent of papers reported approval from an institutional ethics committee for the research reported in the paper. Widespread ethical concerns over the inability of condemned prisoners to give informed consent for organ donation are exacerbated in the People’s Republic of China. Here, the judicial and police system lacks safeguards against procedural abuses. Faulty convictions are extensively documented and extremely difficult to redress. In addition, a growing body of credible evidence suggests that organ harvesting is not limited to condemned prisoners, but also includes prisoners of conscience. It is possible therefore—though not verifiable in any particular case—that peer reviewed publications may contain data obtained from prisoners of conscience killed for the purpose of organ acquisition. Who is responsible for ensuring that data based on research involving organs harvested from non-consenting prisoners is banned from publication? We argue in our paper that reviewers and journal editors have a role to play. Where do the organs come from? In 19 papers involving 2,688 organs transplanted prior to 2010, the source of organs was reported as voluntary donors. But as widely known in the transplantation community, there was no volunteer deceased organ donor program in China before a pilot started in 2010. It therefore seems reasonable to assume that organs may have been sourced from prisoners, making claims about volunteer donation unreliable. The two journals that published the greatest number of Chinese transplant papers identified in our study are Transplantation Proceedings, with 65 of the total 445 papers, and PLOS ONE, with 20. Other journals with papers identified by this study include the American Journal of Transplantation, and Transplantation (the official journal of the peak international body, The Transplantation Society). These journals both have policies that explicitly prohibit the publication of research based on organ transplants from non-consenting and/or prisoner donors. We argue that, if they are not already doing so, reviewers and medical journals should demand information about the source of organs in Chinese transplant research before these are published for the broader public and scientific communities. If they are demanding such information, the responses to those demands should be published. And if they are not satisfied with the responses, they should refuse to publish the research. When a paper is published without identifying the source of the transplanted organs, it risks sending the message that ethical standards may be ignored or breached. This undermines the incentive to comply with these standards in the future. We’re all responsible Our findings raise important and disturbing questions about ethical oversight on the part of all of those involved in the process of reviewing and publishing transplantation research. In response, we propose large-scale retractions of the papers identified by our research that are not consistent with international standards regarding organ donation. We also propose a moratorium on all clinical transplant publications from China pending an international summit. The summit of transplantation community members and other stakeholders could develop appropriate policies and processes for handling future research. Our hopes for these retractions are, however, not high. As one of us (Rogers) found, securing a retraction can be a prolonged process even where there is evidence of overt falsehood in the paper. An article retracted due to concerns about the source of organs used for donation. (Screen shot/John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd/The conversation) Journals are reluctant to retract articles, and even retracted articles continue to be widely cited. Nevertheless, there is growing interest in trying to uphold the integrity of published research, as well as initiatives to demand the publication of all clinical trial data. These initiatives offer some hope that breaches such as the ones we discovered will become less common. As for the authors involved in retracted or ethically non-compliant research, there is little information about the impact on their careers. Being the author on a paper that is retracted may lead to a ban by the journal, trigger an institutional investigation, or have no effect. Academic misconduct investigations by universities are rarely reported in the public domain. Apart from high profile cases like that of He, the nature and extent of the consequences for researchers who breach ethical standards is largely unknown.

    <title><![CDATA[Australian State Senator Condemns Forced Organ Harvesting in China]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F10%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[During a rally joined by thousands of Falun Gong practitioners at Taipei 23 April 2006, four demonstrators play in an action drama against what they said was the Chinese communists’ killing of Falun Gong followers and harvesting of their organs in concentration camps. (Patrick Lin/AFP/Getty Images) On June 17, 2019, an independent people’s tribunal&nbsp;found that it was “beyond doubt” that state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting for profit has been taking place in China for years and “on a significant scale.” The Independent Tribunal Into Forced Organ Harvesting of Prisoners of Conscience in China, known as the China Tribunal, found that these organs are principally sourced from imprisoned prisoners of conscience—the majority of whom are Falun Dafa practitioners. The panel of international experts concluded in their final report that this practice is still taking place. Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, chair of the China Tribunal into forced organ harvesting on the first day of public hearings in London on Dec. 8, 2018. (Justin Palmer) Tribunal chairman, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, stated that “very many people have died indescribably hideous deaths for no reason.”&nbsp;Nice previously led the prosecution of former Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal. The panel described its findings as “indicative” of genocide, and called for international intervention. But Nice said the Tribunal noted with disappointment that “both the UK and Australian governments have expressed no desire properly to test the allegations by themselves or through the United Nations.” Australian Government Yet to Make a Stand Over the years, Victorian Greens Senator Janet Rice has lent her voice in strong condemnation of forced organ harvesting, yet few of her fellows have joined her in speaking out against this practice. “It is horrific and it just underlines what has been previously documented,” Senator Rice told The Epoch Times. Janet Rice, the newly elected Senator for Victoria, spoke at a rally against China’s organ harvesting crimes in downtown Melbourne, Australia, on Sept. 22, 2013. (The Epoch Times) “Countries including Australia need to let China know that this is unacceptable and to hold them to account. “At the very least, we have got to restart our annual Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, which we have not had since 2014. We have to continue to push for China to allow international human rights observers into China so that there can be some further investigation of the extremely concerning evidence that has been revealed through this inquiry process.” However, according to Senator Rice, the Australian government has not yet shown interest in the China Tribunal’s findings. “I think the last thing that happened in our Parliament with relation to organ harvesting in China was a motion that went through the Senate, co-motioned by myself and Senator Eric Abetz (a Tasmanian Liberal Senator), who I don’t agree with much,” she laughed. “But on this issue, we agree. Senator Eric Abetz in discussion with Janet Rice in the Senate at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, on Nov. 29, 2017. (Michael Masters/Getty Images) “We called on the government to consider making it an offense to travel overseas to receive an organ acquired from a non-consensual donor. And that we should also establish a register of people who travel overseas to receive transplants including details on the country they received them in.” The Australian Senate passed motion 121 on Nov. 24, 2016, that acknowledged the problem of unethical organ harvesting in foreign countries including forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience. It recommended the Australian government legislate against its citizens traveling overseas to procure organs from non-consenting donors. “But nothing happened,” said Senator Rice. “I think it’s basically we’ve got both the Labor and Liberal parties who are too scared to upset China,” she said. “They are more concerned about our economic relationship with China and they are willing to overlook these absolutely egregious human rights abuses that are going on.” Senator Rice pointed out that whether it’s the Chinese regime’s harvesting of organs from live Falun Dafa practitioners, the imprisonment of millions of millions of Uyghur people, the persecution of Tibetans, or the kidnapping of Chinese democracy activists in China, it is apparent that the Chinese Communist Party is guilty of appalling human rights abuses. During a rally joined by thousands of Falun Gong practitioners at Taipei 23 April 2006, four demonstrators play in an action drama against what they said was the Chinese communists’ killing of Falun Gong followers and harvesting of their organs in concentration camps. (Patrick Lin/AFP/Getty Images) Dr. Enver Tohti, 57, a former Chinese surgeon who gave evidence before the China Tribunal, described his work at an execution site in Urumqi in northwest China. He was ordered to operate on a man whom Tohti claimed had not been anaesthetised, and who had a gunshot wound on his chest. “I started cutting down the middle and then he started struggling and I knew then that he was still alive,” Tohti told The Telegraph, “but he was too weak to resist me.” “I saw there was blood coming out of the cut which means the heart is still pumping,” said Tohti. He was ordered to remove the victim’s liver and both kidneys. Tohti said he was told by his bosses to “remember that today, nothing happened.” When asked about what steps members of the public can take to bring this issue to the attention of the government, Senator Rice said: “Well I certainly think reading the report of the Tribunal … and the power of actually going and visiting your elected representative is something very powerful that people can do. “In fact, I just reflect upon how it was Falun Gong practitioners right back in 2006 who did that very thing for me when I was Mayor of the City of Maribyrnong. That was 13 years ago, and it was that evidence that was put in front of me that really began my passion for taking action about the appalling situation of human rights in China.” Senator Rice also emphasized the importance of raising awareness in the community “because the vast majority of Australians don’t know what’s going on. “And they should, because China is our biggest trading partner, and by being silent, we are basically being complicit in the human rights abuses going on in China. “So every Australian who benefits from that trading relationship with China has a responsibility to actually inform themselves about what is going on.” Considerations for the Australian Government Michael Danby MP, introduces the Magnitsky Bill (The International Human Rights and Corruption Bill 2018) in the Lower House of the Australian Parliament on Dec. 3, 2018. (Parliament of Australia) According to Senator Rice, Australia has several actions and sanctions which it could consider. For example, by increasing the enforcement of immigration controls against human rights violators through an Australian version of laws known globally as Magnitsky Acts. These laws allow governments to sanction murderers and torturers&nbsp;acting on behalf of states. A future Australian Magnitsky-style law could see Chinese officials involved with the mass incarceration of Uyghurs blocked from entering the country, with their visas rejected and assets frozen. “There are a range of people, including the Greens party room, who are looking at the potential of that … the sorts of sanctions that would be in a Magnitsky Act—I think absolutely should be on the table for discussion.” Senator Rice also noted that there needs to be more action bilaterally, with individual nations working together and having a dialogue with China about what is going on. “China, up until now, has avoided having any powerful sanctions brought into play against them because essentially they have seen to be too big to be putting offside,” she said. “But this just cannot continue. It is part of the flight into abuse of human rights, and so downgrading of the importance of democracy and individual human rights, that it is untenable. “I think we cannot have a global world order with China having increasing power, whilst this attack on people and crimes against human rights continues. “I want us to have a peaceful, productive relationship with the people of China, and for those relations to be strong. These relations are threatened whilst China’s actions are having such an impact on the rights of their own citizens.”]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[In Xinjiang, Even Buying Sugar Can Send You to an Internment Camp]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F9%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Police patrolling as Muslims leave the Id Kah Mosque after the morning prayer on Eid al-Fitr in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China, on June 26, 2017. (Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images) Reproduced from Bitter Winter:&nbsp;A magazine on religious liberty and human rights in china Armed police patrols, public security checkpoints, facial recognition—the ubiquitous surveillance is an inevitable and intrusive part of daily life for residents of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The expansive surveillance, introduced under the pretext of stability maintenance, have brought fear and anxiety, instead of the promised peace and tranquility. The authorities continuously adopt more, often absurd, control measures. White Sugar Controlled as a Material for Explosives Considered as a top priority policy, stability maintenance for the Xinjiang authorities means total control of the population. The previously adopted measures included the requirement to engrave ID numbers on cutting tools and attached them to an iron chain before use; an order for businesses to purchase riot control gear to participate in compulsory drills; every day items are included into lists of strictly controlled articles, and many more. The stability maintenance policy has brought great inconvenience to people’s lives. A prohibitionist measure introduced by the authorities in Xinjiang last year, however, is hard to comprehend: White granulated sugar has been listed as a controlled item as well, restricting and rationing its purchase. The measure has been adopted supposedly to regulate the sale of materials used for making explosives. A resident from Shihezi City revealed that as early as last November, he was required to present his ID card when buying white granulated sugar. The salesperson told him that if he didn’t register his ID number, and the Public Security Bureau finds this out, he will be arrested and put in a “study class,” referring to compulsory indoctrination of people. The salesperson also revealed that once, a clerk sold white granulated sugar to a customer who didn’t bring his ID card, and was fined 4,000 yuan (over $ 510) and sent to “study.” Only a kilogram of white sugar can be purchased with one ID card, according to the new regulations.

(Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images) Face Scans to Enter Home Surveillance and control measures invade deep into people’s lives, restricting them in every respect. At the entrances to some residential complexes in Urumqi City, the capital of Xinjiang, one can frequently see people lining up outside the rotating gate, waiting to scan their ID card or face, to enter their home. The machine not only verifies the identity of residents; more importantly, it records the movements of people for further investigation. If someone doesn’t want to scan their ID card and tries to squeeze through the gate behind someone else, the revolving gate will stop moving, and both people will be trapped inside the gate. According to locals, since last September, these identity-detecting revolving gates have been installed in many residential complexes in Urumqi. All the personal information of residents has already been entered into the system. An elderly person said frankly that such complex entry procedures had caused a great deal of inconvenience. “In the evening, I want to go for a walk, but as soon as I think about how much trouble it is to scan my ID card when leaving and returning to the complex, I don’t want to go out anymore.” When the revolving gate was first put into use, residents would often forget to bring their ID card and would need to contact a security guard to open the gate. “We even have to scan our face or scan our ID card when coming home. How is this ‘home’? It’s like being in prison!” a resident said with a sense of helplessness. IDs Checked Constantly in Public Places This situation isn’t limited to residential complexes. The identity-detecting gates have also been installed at produce markets and wholesale markets in Urumqi. People need to swipe their ID card to enter or leave the markets. These measures are very unpopular with residents. A woman in her forties said bluntly that since this kind of gate was installed, she isn’t even willing to go to the market anymore. “This has caused much trouble for people,” she said. “Despite carrying so many things in your hands, you have to scan your ID card when exiting the market. There are so many people going through the gate, and you have to wait in line. It is very tiring. The main thing is that it’s a complete waste of time.” Merchants are also upset about this. However, fearing retaliation from authorities, they suppress their anger and don’t dare to speak out. A shop proprietress complained that the measures are bad for business because people don’t want to come in. “Business at our market isn’t as good as it was before. But no one dares to say anything about it now,” the woman said with fear. “Anyone who speaks out will be arrested. The government guards against the common people even more strictly than it guards against thieves.” People are Fleeing Xinjiang People walking on the streets of Urumqi may also be required to hand over their cellphone on the grounds of testing it for explosives at any time. If the police have any suspicions, they can even arbitrarily look through the content of one’s cellphone. As a result of such high-pressure control, people feel insecure; many are unwilling to live in Xinjiang anymore. An elderly person who moved to Xinjiang told Bitter Winter that if such measures continue, people will move out, and no one will be willing to come to the Uyghur region. “We’re inspected when walking on the streets. We have to swipe our ID card when entering our residential area or when going to a market,” said the man angrily. “It has been five years since I came to Xinjiang, and we’re still being inspected like this. Are we criminals? Are we terrorists?” A man from inner China who came to visit relatives in Xinjiang thinks that the government-imposed control measures are too strict. “I don’t want to stay here,” he added. A merchant at a shopping mall revealed that three people jointly owned it. By July 2018, two of the owners had withdrawn their capital and left Xinjiang. Out of the 46 shops, initially set up at the mall, only 11 remain. By Li Zaili]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Former Chinese Poverty Assistance Director Charged for Taking 10 Million-plus Yuan in Bribes and Misusing Poverty Assistance Funds]]></title>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese migrant workers wait in a bus as they leave after their shift at a construction site on Dec. 9, 2014 in Beijing, China. It is estimated that there are more than 40 million construction laborers in China, many of whom come from smaller centers to the country's larger cities to find work. (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images) Liu Kunming, former poverty assistance director of Shanxi Province, was recently charged with bribery and abuse of power. He accepted bribes from 216 people that total 10.4 million yuan ($1.5 million). According to a July 6 report from Beijing News, among the 216 people, 93 were poverty assistance directors from different counties and cities. These directors tried to get more funds from the provincial level poverty assistance program by reporting inflated numbers of migrants and residents below the poverty line, and falsely claiming some local development projects were qualified to get government funding. Liu accepted a combined 4.2 million yuan ($611,340) from these county or municipal-level poverty assistance directors. Another group of people who bribed Liu were company executives. Liu accepted 5.64 million yuan ($820,940) from 114 company owners and top executives who tried to obtain national or provincial-level Poverty Alleviation and Development qualification or apply for funding or low-interest loans for certain company projects. Other unidentified individuals bribed Liu to get promotions; and a number of veterans bribed him just to secure a job. The prosecutor claimed that Liu’s abuse of power directly caused a loss of over 3.53 million yuan ($513,810) in poverty-assistance funds, according to Beijing News. Liu, 65, took office as the Poverty Assistance director in Shanxi Province in April 2003, and retired in July 2013. Chinese authorities started investigating him in February 2018, almost five years after he retired. He was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and stripped off from retirement benefits for Party officials when his crimes were corroborated. Linfen Municipal Intermediate Court sentenced Liu to 10.5 years in prison and fined him 600,000 yuan ($87,333) on April 23 this year. Misuse of Poverty Assistance Funds Throughout the Country Several other provincial-level poverty assistance directors have been taken down in recent years. For example, in July 2017, Zhang Xiliang, director of Poverty Assistance in Heilongjiang Province, was investigated; in December 2018, Chen Xiaoping, deputy director of Poverty Assistance in Shaaxi Province, was sacked from his position. An official from the Discipline Inspection Committee of Heilongjiang Province, the Chinese Communist Party’s anti-corruption watchdog, revealed at a press conference in August 2017 that Zhang Xiliang and three other poverty assistance officials misused a total of 10 million yuan in funds for non-qualifying regions and projects. In March 2018 during China’s two sessions (National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference) in Beijing, Hu Jinglin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance, disclosed that poverty alleviation funds being misappropriated and falsely claimed is a nationwide problem, and has so far been found to involve 874 counties in 28 provinces. “Some (funds) went into the pockets of corrupted officials, some were squandered, some were used to benefit officials’ relatives or friends, some were misappropriated,” Hu said. Prior to that, Hu Zejun, Auditor General of the National Audit Office revealed in December of 2017 that 970 officials were found guilty of misusing poverty assistance funds. Data released by the National Audit Office in June last year indicated that in 145 poverty-stricken counties, about 4 billion yuan ($582 million) was pocketed by local corrupted officials. Corruption combined with dereliction of duty have caused huge financial losses. Families in Poverty Denied Poverty Alleviation Funds At the same time, it is not uncommon for families living below the poverty line to be denied poverty alleviation funds. In Kangle County, one of the poverty-stricken counties in northwest China’s Gansu Province, a young woman named Yang Gailan applied for a subsistence allowance in 2013. Village officials rejected her request because her family owned three cows, disregarding the fact that the three cows were the family’s only assets. Instead, the village’s subsistence allowances were granted to other families who were much better off financially than the Yang family. In August 2016, Yang committed suicide by taking poison after killing her four children in desperation. Yang’s husband, working as a migrant worker in another city, also committed suicide after he buried his wife and children. &nbsp;]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Behind Xi Jinping Is A Divided Communist Party and Unengaged Officials]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F7%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese leader Xi Jinping delivers a speech at The Great Hall of The People in Beijing on April 30, 2019. (Andrea Verdelli/Getty Images) News Analysis It’s hard to tell what worries Chinese Communist regime leader Xi Jinping the most—the U.S. trade war in front of him, a divided cabinet, or a whole country of corrupt, self-serving and unfaithful communist officials. Divided at the Top While the trade war has exposed China’s many vulnerabilities and scandals to the entire world, behind closed curtains Xi is struggling with what may end up being more devastating than any external challenge: his immediate inner circle is turning against him. China observers have noticed a major shift in Xi’s strategy and personnel choices. After seven years of successful partnership with Vice President Wang Qishan who led anti-corruption campaigns that won Xi a lot of respect, and Premier Li Keqiang who focused on fixing the economy, Xi turned his favor upon strategist Wang Huning and Vice Premier Han Zheng. Both of his new confidantes served, and are likely still serving, Xi’s arch enemy—former regime leader Jiang Zemin. Wang Huning is known for devising radical communist ideological campaigns, theories, and slogans for Xi and his predecessors. Han Zheng leads the now notorious One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative, and is a hardliner behind the recent Hong Kong and Macau unrest. Both were promoted by Jiang, and are said to be key members of Jiang’s “Shanghai Clique,” a group of national political leaders thought to hold allegiance towards Jiang, a political enemy of Xi. While the two have Xi’s trust, their behaviors have called their loyalty into question. Han, for example, criticized the proposed trade accord with the United States during a meeting with two dozen Chinese top leaders on May 13, according to Wall Street Journal. Wang Huning on the other hand, is allowing, if not ordering party media within his control to speak against Xi. In June, Xinhua.net published two articles that bashed those who choose to “surrender” to the United States in the trade war. The articles took an aggressive and menacing tone and were filled with radical and hateful vernacular commonly used during the 1970s Cultural Revolution. “Stop now,” one of the articles warned those who advocate for collaboration or hold a more moderate stance, “before you do anything that harms your family and pleases your enemies.” People familiar with the matter believe the articles targeted Xi, Wang Qishan, and Li Keqiang—all of whom hope to work towards a resolution ending the trade war with the United States. Inaction in the Middle China has the world’s biggest body of government officials. Most of them are in the middle-tier who interpret, execute, and pass on top leadership’s policies. This middle-tier has been a key obstacle against reform and problem-solving, said Xu Zhong, chief of the Chinese Central Bank Research Bureau, in February during a top economic forum. Most of the policy documents are drafted by the middle-tier officials from various functions, he said. These officials hardly ever reached agreement due to understanding gaps and conflicting interests. This results in removal of controversial policies. “These controversial contents are the reforms that we truly need to solve important and challenging issues,” said Xu. Thus, Beijing’s policy changes are often stuck at the middle level due to the officials’ protection of their own interests, but done in the name of seeking cross-functional consensus. And problems, of course, remain unsolved. Corruption at the Bottom Corruption is a stubborn disease in any communist system. In China where the system has been running for almost 70 years, the extent and severity of corruption are jaw-dropping. In the most recent anti-gang campaign, many local officials were found guilty of collaborating with gangs. Their titles ranged from head of local communist party branch, head of the Political and Legal Affairs Commission, and the chief of the Public Security Bureau. Bribery in local elections is also a common practice, which means a large number of local officials acquired their positions illegally. Worse still, a recent survey by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences showed over 45 percent of village committee members were former gang leaders. It’s no wonder that these local officials focus strongly on getting their investment back with their administrative powers. They may be too busy to take seriously the excessive inspection and evaluation teams sent by the central government. As soon as the teams land in a province or township, the inspection turns into a game of bureaucracy and formality. Even for the inspection teams who do take their jobs seriously, the processes are more hinderance than help for the local officials. Between preparing for the inspection team’s arrival and welcome, to making sure they bring back a positive picture, the local officials have little energy to actually get things done. What’s behind all the troubles is the fact that the communist party itself is what truly hinders development and improvement, and what demotivates officials to do their duty. With more direct interaction with the people, the local officials know better than the top leaders how fragile the party is. Today’s officials are unwilling to work hard for the party, and they are planning out their retreat once the party is in crisis. Xi may be aware of the situation. In a February meeting, Xi warned the party is facing dangers from many directions, and that the country needs to be prepared for major hardships ahead. But the junior officials looked on indifferently, as if they are not part of the system. Economist Cheng Xiaonong believes such behaviors of the local officials pose a major political threat for Beijing, because the measures to save the economy will not get implemented. “More importantly,” Cheng said, “such bureaucratic behaviors marks the loss of loyalty on the officials’ part.”]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F14%2F6%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Police officers stand guard outside the Canadian embassy in Beijing on Jan. 27, 2019. (Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images) TORONTO—A Canadian citizen has been detained in the Chinese city of Yantai, a Canadian government spokesman said on July 13, an incident that comes amid chilly diplomatic relations between the two countries. Global Affairs, as Canada’s foreign ministry is known, did not provide further details or say whether the case was related to the detention of 19 people earlier in the week. Relations between China and Canada nosedived last December after Vancouver police detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co, on a U.S. arrest warrant. Beijing is demanding her return. After Meng’s arrest, China detained two Canadians, accusing them of involvement in stealing state secrets. On July 9, police in Xuzhou, a city in Jiangsu Province, said it had detained 19 people on drug-related charges and that 16 of them were foreigners. Yantai is about 385 miles (620 km) away from Xuzhou. The British Embassy in Beijing said on July 12 that four British nationals have been arrested in eastern China. China’s state radio said some of the detained individuals were teachers at an English education center operated by EF Education First, a privately held Swiss firm that operates in 114 countries.

    <title><![CDATA[Chinese Police Step Up Phone Checks, Using Surveillance Apps]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F06%2F29%2Findex005%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Chinese police question a man (C) in Tiananmen Square, next to the Great Hall of the People, the venue for upcoming meetings of China's legislature in Beijing on March 2, 2015. (GREG BAKER/AFP/Getty Images) Chinese netizens recently reported that police have begun checking people’s smartphones with a special mobile device at subway stations and on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai. Beijing police said that the tool is only for scanning people’s IDs, but netizens and experts who dug deeper have discovered that the product can extract personal data from smartphones without authorization from the smartphone owner. Checkpoints A Beijing netizen sent a video to the Chinese-language Epoch Times on June 17, which showed that Beijing police have set up a temporary checkpoint at the Dongzhimen Subway Station to check travelers’ smartphones. “The police is checking everything on the phone,” the person shooting the video can be heard saying. Ms. Cheng, a Shanghai dissident, also told U.S.-based broadcaster and sister media NTD that local police on the streets have also begun checking people’s phones. Several netizens from Shanghai and Beijing told NTD that the police mainly check whether there are photos or videos about recent Hong Kong protests against a controversial extradition bill, a topic banned in mainland China. The police also look for whether people have installed virtual private network (VPN) and other apps that can allow users to bypass the Chinese firewall and access foreign websites that are banned inside China. On June 21, the Beijing police department published a statement on its official Weibo account, denying netizens’ complaints that officers were accessing people’s smartphones. In the statement, it said that the police did not take away people’s smartphones, but were using their “mobile police terminals” to check IDs. Surveillance Tool The statement also explained what the device does: “Police can use this ‘smartphone’ [mobile police terminal] to accomplish all types of police work. This device is the perfect embodiment of advanced police technology as well as applying big data.” “Mobile police terminal” devices have proliferated in certain years. Many software developers tout their success at scoring government clients. Xinda Jie’an, for example, said on its website that its devices for police in Henan Province can identify people’s faces after taking their photo. All their background information will then become available to police, including contact information, any prior criminal record, cars and other vehicles that are registered under the person, and so on. For foreigners, their profiles and passport numbers can be accessed after police can take a photo or a finger scan with the device. The police can also input more information about the foreigner’s behavior into the database. In the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where the resident Uyghur population is closely monitored by authorities, Hikvision-developed devices can connect the police network via any mobile carrier, allowing police to upload and download data from people’s phones and into the police database. Meanwhile, Vickn, a developer of mobile communication-based security software, uses hardware manufactured by Chinese tech giant Huawei to operate its police devices. According to its website, Vickn supplies to police in Jiangsu, Ningxia, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces. According to Vickn’s product page, its mobile police terminal can identify people by scanning their fingerprints. Police can then access the person’s file on its database, which includes information on their homes. Surveillance App Since 2016, netizens have complained that after police checked their phones, a MFsocket app mysteriously appears on their phones. They are unable to uninstall it. Recently, netizens again reported this phenomenon. On June 25, a French cybersecurity engineer and vigilante hacker who uses the pseudonym Elliot Alderson, published his research findings on the MFsocket app on Medium.com. Alderson found out: “[MFsocket] is asking a lot of dangerous permissions: – Read your call log, your contacts, your SMS, your calendar, your SD card – Disable the lock screen – Access your location – install a new app without your consent.” “Moreover, we can see that the activity doesn’t have the category launcher which means that this app doesn’t have an icon,” Alderson wrote. He concluded that the app was a surveillance tool. This article previously misreported where the hacker self-identified as&nbsp;Elliot Alderson was based. The Epoch Times regrets the error.]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Wife Sees Jailed Chinese Rights Lawyer For First Time in 4 Years, Says He’s a ‘Changed Person’]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F06%2F29%2Findex004%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Wang Quanzhang with his wife, Li Wenzu, and their son. Wang Quanzhang, a human rights lawyer, has been detained in China without trial since August 2015. (Courtesy of Li Wenzu) It was a long-awaited meeting for both. Li Wenzu had not seen her husband, Wang Quanzhang, since the Chinese lawyer was jailed for his human rights advocacy four years ago. Chinese authorities have continuously denied her visitation rights. She would often travel to the prison he was detained at, and call his name from outside the prison wall, in the hopes that he could hear. Since five years ago, when Wang was arrested and detained by Chinese authorities amid a nationwide crackdown of human rights lawyers and activists in July 2015, Li had been waiting to see her husband’s face. The day before Li’s first-ever scheduled prison visit on June 28, she wrote on Twitter that “the waiting time was so dragged-out.” After traveling nearly 420 miles from Beijing to the Linyi Prison in Shandong Province, Li found the half-hour meeting nothing like what she expected. The prison deployed hundreds of police outside. As Li walked into the reception room with her 6-year-old son, Quanquan, she had to pause for a moment before she could recognize the man. Sitting across the glass window was a thinner, older, and wearier-looking version of her husband. Wang Quanzhang was detained in 2015 and sentenced on Jan. 28, 2019. (Photo from Wang’s family) Changed Person Li said that both Wang’s personality and appearance had changed so much that she would not have recognized him had they met on the street. “I smiled and waved to him in excitement, but he glanced at me without any expression, and tilted his head to the side without looking at me,” Li wrote in a tweet after their meeting. In an interview on June 28, Li recounted to The Epoch Times how their meeting went. She said he appeared happy upon seeing their son, but a sense of worry soon clouded his face. “He wasn’t in a good state, I could tell that he was under extreme stress and fear. We couldn’t even have a conversation,” Li said. Li said that Wang was anxious about her safety. “He expressed concerns that I would be arrested, that our child would be forced out of school.” “He asked me not to visit him in the next few months,” Li said. Li noted that he appeared easily agitated and had difficulty remembering recent events. When Quanquan asked his father whether he had been eating well, Wang said slowly in a robotic voice that he had everything he needed, including extra food. When Li asked what the “extras” were, he began to scratch his head with a troubled look and repeated the question to himself. “I’m fine, the prison has been treating me very well, it’s not like what you guys think,” Wang said in a high tone, claiming that he had put on weight while in prison, Li recalled in her tweet. “Tears streamed down as I looked at the thinned face of Quanzhang … His two front teeth that used to be neatly aligned now shows a huge space in between,” she wrote, adding that Wang seemed like a totally different person. “He looked at me … as if looking at a stranger and not the wife he hasn’t seen for four years.” Li also said she had never heard him speak in that aggressive tone. “He wasn’t like that before, Quanzhang was a mild person,” Li said. “He never lost his temper in front of me.” When the guards ended the meeting, Wang walked away without looking back at them. She observed that five or six guards were monitoring them as they spoke, with another taking notes beside Wang throughout the visit. Another guard was also filming them on a camcorder, according to Li. Li Wenzu (L), the wife of detained human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang, walks on the outskirts of Beijing to Tianjin, where she believes her husband is being held, on April 5, 2018.&nbsp;(Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images) Controlling One’s Mind After he was taken away by police amid the nationwide crackdown, known as the 709 Incident, he was detained for roughly three years. On Jan. 28 this year, in a closed-door trial, Wang was sentenced to four and a half years in prison on charges of subversion—a euphemism for activism that draws the Chinese regime’s ire. In seeking Wang’s release and her visitation rights, Li has met with government officials from different countries, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.K. Ambassador to China Barbara Woodward. Chen Guangcheng, a Chinese human rights lawyer and civil rights activist, told The Epoch Times that the goal of the Chinese Communist Party was to control their thoughts. He suggested that Chinese authorities likely arranged the meeting between Wang and Li so that the sense of desperation and fear would spread from Wang to his family—and stop them from being vocal about his case.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images) Chen fled China to the United States in 2012 with the help of U.S. officials. He had been under house arrest before he planned a daring escape to the U.S. embassy in Beijing. Speaking from his personal experience, Chen said when suppressing dissidents, the Chinese regime often plays with their fears while they are detained in a secluded environment, seeking to inflict mental pressure. “If you don’t cave in, they would use all kinds of ways to ‘educate’ you with fear and threats,” Chen said. “They instill this kind of fear in you, and you don’t know any other information nor the true situation. This will prey on your mind.” Chen said that their ultimate goal was to wear them out until “you no longer care about the injustices in society and just live your life,” Chen said. “They want the shackles to be secured in Li Wenzu and Wang Quanzhang’s minds for the rest of their lives.” Follow Eva on Twitter: @EvaSailEast]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F06%2F29%2Findex003%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[A 21-year-old student has died after falling from a building in Hong Kong on June 29, after leaving an apparent message on the staircase protesting the city’s recent controversial extradition bill, local media reported. Lo Hiu-yan, a first-year female student studying arts at Education University, left a 91-word message at an upper-floor staircase of Fuk Tai building in Fanling, Hong Kong, calling for the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill, along with other demands urged by millions of Hongkongers. Over the past few weeks millions of people have taken to the city’s streets to protest a proposed extradition law that would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for trial. Opponents say that given the Chinese regime doesn’t operate under the rule of law, the bill would enable it to seek the extradition of its critics in Hong Kong with impunity. The student fell from the building around 4 p.m. local time on June 29 and was confirmed dead at the scene by ambulance crew, according to Hong Kong media Apple Daily. Unnamed sources told the outlet she had previously participated in anti-extradition-bill protests. According to Apple Daily, her message on the wall, written in red and addressed to Hongkongers, read: “Although we have been fighting for a long time, we must not forget our beliefs from the very beginning and must keep persisting. “[We] strongly demand the complete withdrawal of the [extradition] bill, the retraction of the labeling [of a June 12 demonstration] as a ‘riot,’ the release of [arrested] student demonstrators, the resignation of [Hong Kong leader] Carrie Lam, and the punishment of the police.” The message ended with the line: “I hope to exchange my life for the fulfillment of two million people’s wishes. Please continue to persevere, you all.” Lo also posted a picture of her message on the wall to her Instagram page, Apple Daily reported. Police have since covered her written message with a black sheet, the outlet added. Lo was not a resident of the building. Over a hundred mourners laid flowers and notes at the scene in remembrance of Lo as of the evening of June 29. Students at Education University, where Lo had attended, will hold a mourning ceremony for Lo on June 30.

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha This is not the first death associated with the protests. On June 15, a 35-year-old man in a yellow raincoat died after unfurling a banner protesting the proposed extradition laws from the side of a shopping mall in Admiralty. The man, wearing a yellow raincoat, called for the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill and for Hong Kong Leader Carrie Lam to step down. Written on the back of his raincoat was “Carrie Lam Kills Hong Kong.” Hongkongers mourned the man in the following weeks. Many left tributes to him with flowers and notes at the scene, and some showed up in yellow raincoats in later protests.

    <title><![CDATA[Chinese Rights Lawyer Demoted From Teaching Post at Shandong University]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F06%2F29%2Findex002%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Rights lawyer and university lecturer Liu Shuqing is shown in an undated photo. A university in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong has fired a lecturer and human rights lawyer after he "repeatedly published inappropriate comments" in the media, RFA has learned.Rights lawyer Liu Shuqing, who also works at a public interest law firm, was told to stop teaching classes at the Shandong Qilu University of Technology last year.The university issued a statement accusing Liu of "violating teaching standards of practice" and being a "bad influence."Liu, who was hired to teach by the college's school of chemical engineering, said he had also been rated "unqualified" in a recent staff assessment, although he was the only one in his faculty to fail his assessment.The school will now go through a disciplinary process based on two posts he made on the internet, about a government grading system for lawyers and the abuse of official power.But he said he had never discussed his opinions while teaching, and that there was nothing illegal in either post."I told them that teaching is only one of my professions, but that my identity is as a citizen, and that citizens have the right to freedom of speech," Liu told RFA."Both of these posts are still on WeChat, and haven't been blocked or deleted," he said. "I am very disappointed that the school has punished me anyway."Not yet firedLiu has already been ordered to stop teaching, but hasn't been formally fired. Instead, he has been demoted to the status of teaching assistant.His contract states that the university can fire him if he fails two consecutive annual assessments, however."I have been teaching for more than 10 years," Liu told RFA. "I think I am a very competent teacher. I am qualified ... It is very unfair."He said he would see whether or not the school would accept an offer of arbitration, as hinted at in their letter informing him of the decision.An employee who answered the phone at the university's personnel department declined to comment."I don't know this teacher, and I'm not familiar with the case," the employee said. "You should call the propaganda department."Growing censorshipAcademics say the ruling Chinese Communist Party is stepping up its censorship of academics in an unconstitutional bid to silence even the mildest criticism.Former Guizhou University professor Yang Shaozheng, who was fired outright after he made comments critical of the Communist Party in an online article, said self-censorship in colleges and universities is a growing problem on Chinese campuses."What it means is that no one in this society is willing to insist on justice and the rule of law," Yang said. "They are forcing teachers and other members of society to stay silent about whatever they think is problematic.""If you go on like this for a long time, this country will lose its sense of right and wrong."Liu has previously represented Beijing rights lawyer Wang Yu, who was the first of hundreds to be detained and sanctioned in a nationwide crackdown launched in July 2015.He has also counted New Citizens' Movement found Xu Zhiyong, Harbin petitioner Xu Chunhe, and many other rights activists among his clients.'Political training'Earlier this week, China's education ministry launched a new wave of political training for colleges and universities that aims to instill the ideology of President Xi Jinping and late supreme leader Mao Zedong in staff and students alike.The Ministry of Education released on Monday a five-year training plan for teachers via a series of "political theory" courses in colleges and universities.According to the ministry, "it is necessary to train dozens of ideological and political scholars with extensive influence ... as well as hundreds of leaders in ideological and political education."Under the plan, thousands of teachers and professors will study the classics of Marxism alongside the Thought of Xi Jinping, Mao Zedong, and late supreme leader Deng Xiaoping.The results of their theoretical research should then be integrated into their teaching materials, the ministry said.All colleges and universities will be required to send at least two qualified teachers to participate in the program, achieving full coverage of all Chinese tertiary institutions within five years, it said.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Wen Yuqing for the Cantonese Service.

    <title><![CDATA[Former Interpol Chief Stands Trial For Bribery in China's Tianjin]]></title>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Former Interpol president Meng Hongwei stood trial in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin on Thursday, as his wife said she wasn't sure the man presented on state media footage was her husband.Meng "confessed" to accepting more than U.S. $2 million in bribes and expressed regret for his crime, the Tianjin No. 1 Intermediate People's Court said in a statement.Official footage of the trial aired by state broadcaster CCTV showed Meng in a beige jacket standing between two police officers in a court, with a small group of people sitting behind him.According to the indictment, the charges relate to Meng's tenure as minister, vice-minister and ruling Chinese Communist Party secretary for public security, and as head of the Chinese marine police, between 2005 and 2017.Chengdu-based rights activist Chen Yunfei said the amount Meng was accused of receiving seemed low, compared with bribes of hundreds of millions of yuan (1 million yuan = U.S. $146,000) ascribed to much lower-ranking officials in China."If he really did accept bribes, then this probably wasn't the actual amount," Chen said. "County-level and district-level party secretaries get far larger sums than this.""It's likely that something else is going on here."Last month, France granted political asylum to Meng's wife Grace and the couple's two children, after she told police she was the target of an unsuccessful abduction attempt at the beginning of the year.Meng went missing last year during a trip back to China.He was placed under investigation for corruption at a secret location "on the outskirts of Beijing" after Interpol accepted his resignation with no questions asked on Oct. 7, 2018.Interpol gave no reason for the resignation, nor did it make any public comment on the detention of its president. Meng had been elected to lead the international police agency until 2020.Grace Meng, whose Chinese name is Gao Ge, was left behind in France with scant information, other than a social media message from her husband telling her to "wait for my call," and then a knife emoji signifying danger.Grace Meng said recently that Chinese officials had presented "no proof whatsoever to back up their charges," and has said that she still fears kidnap attempts.Overseas-based Chinese activists say China has a long track record in cross-border abductions.Anti-corruption campaignAn independent Beijing-based scholar surnamed Song said Meng's prosecution, which will almost certainly result in a jail term, is another example of political prosecutions under the aegis of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign."If Meng Hongwei only took bribes of [U.S. $2 million], then he's probably the cleanest official [in China]," Song said."All this proves is that there is factional strife at the highest levels of Communist Party leadership, and that the anti-corruption campaign is selective, and depends on factional struggles," he said.Reports suggest that Meng was appointed vice-minister for public security by disgraced former public security minister Zhou Yongkang, who rose to power at the head of China feared "stability maintenance" system,Zhou was jailed for life by the Tianjin No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in June 2015, after being found guilty of bribe-taking, abuse of power, and disclosure of state secrets in a secret trial.Zhou's sentence came rumors of a political coup attempt to topple Xi by him and jailed former Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai. China's securities regulator Liu Shiyu later told top finance officials during the 19th Party Congress in 2017 that senior figures had "conspired openly to usurp party leadership."Earlier that year, Xi had accused five disgraced party officials, including Zhou and Bo, of involvement in "political conspiracies."Reported by Qiao Long for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by the Cantonese Service.

    <title><![CDATA[Calls Grow For an Independent Probe Into Police Violence During Hong Kong Protests]]></title>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Authorities in Hong Kong on Tuesday faced a growing number of calls for a public inquiry into their handling of recent mass protests against plans to allow extraditions to mainland China, as chief executive Carrie Lam canceled a scheduled meeting of her cabinet.Professional and religious organizations called on the government to set up an independent investigation committee to probe the events of June 12 and examine police actions, after Amnesty International said the city's police acted with unlawful force when using tear gas, rubber and textile bullets, and batons to disperse crowds of unarmed civilians on June 12.They said the government's insistence that the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) could handle any complaints was fundamentally flawed, as any complaints end up being investigated by the police themselves."The IPCC is itself part of the police force, and it's very easy to sympathize and see things from one's colleagues' point of view," Sing Ming, associate social sciences professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said.Meanwhile, former colonial-era second-in-command Anson Chan hit out at Lam, saying she bears the greatest responsibility for the government's handling of the political crisis around planned amendments to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which would allow alleged criminal suspects to be sent to face trial in mainland China.Britain also urged Hong Kong to conduct an independent investigation into police actions on June 12."I today urge the Hong Kong SAR government to establish a robust, independent investigation into the violent scenes that we saw," foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told members of parliament. "The outcome of that investigation will inform our assessment of future export license applications to the Hong Kong police."Hunt said no new licenses for "crowd control equipment" would be issued to Hong Kong importers unless human rights concerns were addressed.Clear hostilityBack in Hong Kong, barrister Geoffrey Yeung of the Progressive Lawyers Group, said police tactics in the face of mass protest need to be looked at across the board."We could see for example that there's clear hostility towards journalists or the protesters at the scene, whether there was something that went wrong," Yeung told government broadcaster RTHK. "Was it because the police officers went off the guidelines or was it because the guidelines themselves were problematic?"Hundreds of protesters once more converged on government buildings on Monday, following much larger civil disobedience action by thousands of people on Friday.The government said it wouldn't be holding a scheduled Executive Council (ExCo) meeting, although protesters only targeted immigration and tax headquarters and the Legislative Council (LegCo), before dispersing peacefully."The chief executive was elected by just 1,200 people," a protester surnamed Chan told RFA on Monday, in reference to the Election Committee that is itself hand-picked by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. "That's why she needs to be held to account by the public.""The trouble is that even if one or two million people take to the streets, the government doesn't have to answer to them, so I think that this movement ... is useful, but that it's not going to be enough," he said.'We've already had this'An employee surnamed Cheung who works at Revenue Tower said she is broadly supportive of the protest movement."I do basically support them, but I think we've already had this on Friday, and now they're doing it again, which I think is going to alienate a lot of people," Cheung said."So even though I support them, I don't now, because I think they should have left us some way to go out and buy food and come back in again."Pro-democracy lawmakers accused Lam's administration of hiding from the public by canceling the ExCo meeting."When the government claims they want to connect with Hong Kong people, this is blatantly a disconnection with Hong Kong people," Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung told lawmakers in comments reported by RTHK."The conflict is still in the society about the extradition bill," he said. The government should face up to the conflict ... and not be hiding from the scene."Pro-democracy camp convenor Claudia Mo said officials are very nervous following the mass civil disobedience actions of recent weeks."This government has become a joke for the Hong Kong community and the international community," Mo told reporters.Business as usualDevelopment secretary Michael Wong said much official business is proceeding as normal, however."It's true that the social atmosphere right now is quite tense, and we think that if there is a chance for the society to relax a bit, for everyone to calm down, then we can be pragmatic and do our job," he said.Meanwhile, the government is facing a legal challenge over the failure of special tactical unit police officers to display their identification numbers during clashes on June 12.A local resident has applied for a judicial review after he was told to stop taking pictures of the protests by police, and is calling on the court to ban police officers from carrying out their duties without displaying a valid ID.Reported by Gao Feng for RFA's Mandarin Service, and by Tseng Lap-yin for the Cantonese Service.
