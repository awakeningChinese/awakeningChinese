                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has urged a national security panel to review popular Chinese video-sharing app  censorship to toe the Chinese Communist Party line.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an Oct. 9 </span><a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9ba023e4-2f4b-404a-a8c0-e87ea784f440/FCEFFE1F54F3899795B4E5F1F1804630.20191009-letter-to-secretary-mnuchin-re-tiktok.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Rubio said Chinese-owned apps, including TikTok, “are increasingly being used to censor content and silence open discussion on topics deemed sensitive by the Chinese Government and Communist Party.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<div class="cover_container"><div class="cover_container_static"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tik Tok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Technology Co.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubio urged the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (</span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/the-committee-on-foreign-investment-in-the-united-states-cfius" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFIUS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), an interagency panel administered by the Department of Treasury that reviews mergers and stock purchases for national security concerns, to scrutinize ByteDance’s 2017 acquisition of Musical.ly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok, known as “Douyin” in China, was launched by ByteDance in 2016. In the following year, ByteDance acquired fellow Chinese social media service Musical.ly, which had offices in Shanghai and Los Angeles, for $1 billion. In August 2018, ByteDance dropped the Musical.ly brand and launched a revamped version of TikTok.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), in a 2019 </span><a href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/china-economic-watch/growing-popularity-chinese-social-media-outside-china-poses-new-risks" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, estimated that there were 400 million TikTok users in China, along with 80 million in the United States, and 120 million in the rest of the world.&nbsp;</span></p><div style="margin : 5px auto 30px; text-align: center"><div style="display: block;text-align: center"> <div id="inside_ad_336x280_1"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his letter, Rubio pointed out that there continues to be “ample and growing evidence” that TikTok scrubbed content on issues deemed “sensitive” by Beijing from its platform, such as Tiananmen Square, Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Guardian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that TikTok instructed its moderators to censor certain videos that mention certain topics, including Tiananmen Square, and the spiritual practice Falun Gong. The report was based on leaked documents detailing the app’s moderation guidelines, that TikTok said were replaced in May.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a spiritual discipline involving meditative exercises and moral teaching, which was banned by the Chinese regime in 1999. For 20 years, its adherents have been subject to a sweeping persecution campaign involving arbitrary detention, forced labor, brainwashing, and torture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubio also questioned why TikTok had only a few videos of the  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, CFIUS forced Chinese company Beijing Kunlun Tech to divest dating app Grindr, which it had acquired a majority stake in 2016—a rare example of the regulator undoing an acquisition that had already been completed.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>ByteDance</b></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though ByteDance is a private company, it has publicly supported the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) initiatives, such as its One Belt, One Road (OBOR) policy.&nbsp;</span></p><div style="margin : 5px auto 30px; text-align: center"><div style="display: block;text-align: center"><div id="in_article_ads_1"></div></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many private companies in China, it has a Party committee embedded within the organization, put in place to ensure the company runs in accordance with the mandates of the CCP.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2018, Zhang Yiming, founder and CEO of ByteDance, and over 100 employees who were also members of the company’s Party committee, took part in a class to learn about the issues discussed at a two-day national conference on cybersecurity held a few days earlier, CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily reported.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secretary of ByteDance’s Party committee, Zhang Fuping, said in a speech at the session that the “correct political direction, public opinion, and values” must be integrated into every one of the company’s products.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the event, Zhang also said that ByteDance had over “200 million users” worldwide, including those in the countries that have signed up to the OBOR initiative. He added that the company must “infuse with the country’s national development strategy,” and take up “corporate responsibility for the build-up of the digital silk road.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beijing rolled out its flagship OBOR foreign policy initiative in 2013 in an effort to rebuild the ancient commercial trading route or “silk road.” It aims to bolster the regime’s geopolitical influence by investing in massive infrastructure projects on the continents of Asia, Europe, and Africa.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, ByteDance also convened a class session for Party members in the company following a CCP national conference on propaganda and ideological work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an article by the China Federation of Internet Societies, an organization supervised by the regime’s internet censorship agency, the Cyberspace Affairs Administration, Zhang spoke about how implementing the learnings from the conference was an “important political mission.”
